Witnesses, suspect sought after Vaughan fake-rideshare assault York Regional Police are reminding people who use ridesharing services to always verify vehicles, licence plates and drivers. York Regional Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was sexually assaulted in Vaughan on Friday, Nov. 8.

Around 7 a.m., police said, the victim was waiting for a bus near Countryside Road and Bramalea Road when the suspect approached her in a black sedan, presented himself as a rideshare driver and offered her a ride.

The suspect then drove the victim to the area of Highway 27 and Nashville Road in Vaughan where he sexually assaulted her, police said in a news release.

The victim was able to get away, and two bystanders in a grey or white vehicle helped her. Investigators say the suspect then fled the area.

The suspect is described as a man who was about five-feet-six inches tall and between 23 and 25 years of age, who had black hair, black eyes, a thin build, and a full beard approximately two inches in length.

Previously, Peel police had disclosed a similar crime on the same day, saying that in Brampton around 7 a.m. Friday, an 18-year-old woman was assaulted by a man presenting himself as a rideshare driver.

York Regional Police are reminding people who use ridesharing services to always verify vehicles, licence plates and drives.

Anyone with information on the Vaughan incident, including bystanders, is asked to call the York Regional Police Special Victims Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071, or contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS, or leave an anonymous tip online at www.1800222tips.com.

Uranus Might Have Experienced a Freak Event When Voyager 2 Visited
Much of the understanding of the seventh planet comes from a brief flyby nearly 40 years ago, which researchers now say overlapped with an exceptional solar event.
Our understanding of Uranus might have been all wrong for nearly 40 years.

In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft zoomed past Uranus as part of a grand tour of the outer solar system. That flyby, lasting just five hours, remains to date the only visit to Uranus by a spacecraft from Earth, with much of our understanding of the planet coming from that brief encounter.

Peculiarly, as Voyager 2 soared about 50,000 miles above the planet, it found that Uranus was quite different from other worlds in the outer solar system. In particular, its protective magnetic field, known as a magnetosphere, was devoid of plasma, something prevalent around other planets.

“We observed this empty magnetosphere,” said Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And its radiation belts, regions of the planet’s magnetic field that trap high-energy particles, were surprisingly intense, something that “breaks current radiation belt theory,” Dr. Jasinski said.

Now we may know why. In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, Dr. Jasinski and his colleagues suggest that Voyager 2’s visit flyby occurred during an exceptional increase in solar activity, which caused shrinking of the planet’s magnetosphere. That created conditions at Uranus that occurred just four percent of the time in the data that the team analyzed.

“If we had arrived a week earlier, we would have had a completely different picture of Uranus,” Dr. Jasinski said.

Fran Bagenal, an astrophysics and planetary science professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a member of the Voyager program’s plasma science team, said it was a “big surprise” when she saw Dr. Jasinski present the research at a conference this summer. “Why didn’t we see this?” she said. “I was kicking myself. It was completely out of the blue.”

The research could also spark important questions as scientists plan a possible return to this fascinating world by a NASA space probe.
When Voyager 2 swooped past Uranus, Dr. Jasinski believes the planet was being hit by something called a co-rotating interaction region. This is a burst of activity from the sun’s surface that sweeps out into space as the star rotates, ejecting long streams of plasma to the edge of the solar system. This phenomenon has been observed affecting other planets, such as Saturn. But it hadn’t been considered for Uranus.

“Their result is solid,” said Adam Masters, a space and planetary scientist at Imperial College London. “Everyone was focused on data taken near to the planet, but they looked back at data taken when the spacecraft was approaching and leaving the Uranus system.”

Dr. Bagenal added that “it explains why the density that we saw was so low.”

The solar activity would have increased the pressure of the solar wind on Uranus’s magnetosphere by 20 times as much, Dr. Jasinski said, squashing it to just a fifth of its normal volume. This would explain both the decreased amount of plasma detected near Uranus, which would be trapped closer to the planet inside the magnetosphere, and the intensity of the radiation belts, which would have been filled with energetic electrons from the sun.

NASA is working on a mission to return to Uranus next decade. It plans to launch a spacecraft by 2032 that would orbit the planet for the first time and send a probe into its atmosphere. The new paper highlights just how little we know about the planet, and how eager scientists are to return.

And scientists say there are good reasons to study Uranus and its fellow ice giant, Neptune: they provide a point of comparison for understanding many similar worlds around distant stars.

“The reason we care about Uranus and Neptune, and their quirky magnetic fields and interiors, is because the most populous class of exoplanets are super-Earths and sub-Neptunes,” said Heidi Hammel, an astronomer and planetary scientist at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy.

And many planetary scientists are enthusiastic about better understanding Uranus, which is particularly unusual in that it orbits on its side relative to the other planets, possibly the result of a giant impact early in its life. “It’s got extreme seasons, and the magnetic field is rotating at a very weird angle,” Dr. Masters said. Other questions abound, he added: Where did Uranus form? How does its atmosphere work? Do its moons conceal oceans like those around Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune?

“We have lots of mysteries we want to resolve,” he said.

Perhaps the planet, though, is slightly less unusual than Voyager 2’s flyby suggested. “This is why we need to go back,” Dr. Bagenal said.

Engines on 1.4 million Honda vehicles might fail, so US regulators open an investigation

(CNN)
 — 
The U.S. government’s highway safety agency is investigating complaints that engines can fail on as many as 1.4 million Honda and Acura vehicles.

The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers the 2016 through 2020 Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, as well as the 2018 through 2020 Honda Odyssey and Acura TLX. Also included is the 2017 through 2019 Honda Ridgeline.

The agency says in documents posted on its website Monday that connecting rod bearings on vehicles with 3.5-liter V6 engines can fail, leading to complete engine failure. Connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft and convert vertical motion to move the wheels.

Honda recalled about 250,000 vehicles in November of 2023 to fix the same problem. But the agency says it has 173 complaints from owners who reported connecting rod bearing failures, yet their vehicles weren’t included in the recall. One owner reported a crash with no injuries.

The agency said it’s opening a recall query to determine the severity of the problem in vehicles not included in the 2023 recall.

Honda said it will cooperate with NHTSA on the investigation.

In documents explaining the 2023 recall, the automaker said had 1,450 warranty claims due to the bearing problem but no reports of injuries. Dealers were to inspect and repair or replace the engines if needed.

Where the Turkey Comes From the Field, Not the Freezer
On the hunt for wild birds in Minnesota, where a small but spirited cohort loves the challenge, and the cooking that follows.

Kristie Swenstad was napping in the back of plywood deer blind on a cold fall morning when her father nudged her awake and handed her a shotgun.

She was 12.

“I was excited because I was doing what my dad did,” she said. “I was going to help fill the freezer.”

Ms. Swenstad is 36 now. A former high school basketball star and homecoming queen, she owns a tailor shop in Alexandria, a little lake town 130 miles northwest of Minneapolis. And she wants more people to understand the beauty and challenge of hunting for your supper.

That’s why on a frosty October morning, I was crouched next to her inside a canvas blind designed to look vaguely like a hay bale. She had a shotgun in her hand and turkey on her mind.

The lean birds she was hunting are about as much like big-breasted Thanksgiving turkeys as a slice of aged Cheddar is like a Kraft single. As a holiday centerpiece, their lean carcasses would disappoint most Americans.

But heading into the woods in pursuit of a bird Ben Franklin called both respectable and courageous is a singular thrill that adds variety to a hunting family’s table.

Although its farmers raise about 40 million commercial turkeys a year — more than any other state — Minnesota is not among the top places to hunt wild turkey. They had been nearly eradicated by the late 1800s. In the early 1970s, the state Department of Natural Resources moved 29 Eastern turkeys in Missouri to southeastern Minnesota. Now, the wild turkey population is more than 70,000.

The odds of bagging one aren’t great. On average, only about a quarter of the 60,000 people who hold licenses for the fall and spring hunts head home with a bird.

Still, wild turkeys are part of the fabric of life here. In urban areas, they are an object of both fasciation and annoyance, chasing children and clawing up gardens. A flock that hangs out on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis is so beloved it has its own Instagram account.

Gov. Tim Walz plays up his turkey-hunting bona fides, hosting a turkey hunting event each spring. In the days after he was picked as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in August, his recipe for turkey hot dish became a media sensation.

The number of Americans who hunt turkeys (about 3.1 million) pales in comparison to deer hunters (about 11 million), according to the National Deer Association. Deer hunting is a quieter, more solitary pursuit and perhaps more revered in rural communities. But turkey hunting has its devotees, especially in the spring when the woods are loud with the heart-pounding yelps and gobbles of male turkeys looking to mate.

The trick is to use well-placed hen decoys and calls from a practiced hunter to attract the toms.

“It’s so entertaining, like watching guys in a bar trying to impress the ladies,” said Brita Edgerton, 43, a bowhunting friend of Ms. Swenstad’s who owns an audiovisual production company in Duluth. “They start waltzing in with their big tails and plumage, showing off.”

The fall turkey hunt is different. It’s smaller and less social. Fewer hunters are looking for turkey, and since the birds aren’t mating, they tend to gather in quiet groups.

“Fall is to get the meat and just be out here,” said Ms. Swenstad, who has hunted elk during a snowstorm in the Wyoming backcountry and long-horned antelopes called gemsboks with a bow and arrow in South Africa. One gemsbok’s taxidermied head is stored in her former bedroom at her parents’ house.

It would be hard to be a member of her family if you didn’t want to pick up a gun and head to the woods. Text strings are filled with hunting jokes and wildlife photos. Getting a firearm safety certificate is as much a rite of passage as getting a driver’s license.

Ms. Swenstad’s uncle, John, belongs to the National Wild Turkey Federation, a conservation and hunting organization. And, like all the men in the family, he’s worked as a firefighter. He gives each child in the family a .22-caliber rifle to use in their gun-safety classes. He has already set aside one for his 3-year-old grandniece, whose mother, Moli Swenstad, 29, hunted deer until a month before her daughter was born.

A favorite family party trick is to ask the toddler where you shoot a turkey. “In the face!” she squeals. (The idea is to minimize the amount of birdshot in the meat.)

Ms. Swenstad’s mother, Lynnette, 58, usually stayed home and cooked while the others hunted. That changed on Mother’s Day 2010, when she decided to join in a turkey hunt. Now she is as devoted as everyone else. “I like sitting in the tranquillity of the forest,” she said.

She is also practical. When a turkey wandered to the edge of the yard a few years ago, she took aim from the patio and then walked across the lawn in slippers to retrieve it.

When someone bags a deer, everyone gets together to butcher it on plastic cutting boards set on work tables in Ms. Swenstad’s father’s cabinet shop in nearby Osakis. Backstraps and roasts are cut out whole. Some meat is reserved for jerky. Trimmed, lean chunks go into a grinder, sometimes mixed with lard from a whole pig the family buys to share.

“We just have venison in our freezer,” Moli Swenstad said. “That’s our red meat of choice.”

Few things irritate the Swenstads more than people who criticize hunting but buy meat in the supermarket. If you choose to eat meat, taking animals from the wild is the most ethical, environmentally sound option, Ms. Swenstad said. There are no torturous feedlots, she said, and most hunters are dedicated to preserving wildlife habitats.

“I like the fact that I know where my food is coming from, and I worked hard to get it on my table rather than just going to the store, where you don’t know where it came from or what’s in it,” she said. “These turkeys are the closest thing you can get to pure.”

Some hunters will roast them whole, but that’s not ideal. The birds have long, thin breasts and tough, tendon-filled leg muscles. Some cooks might throw the legs into a slow-cooker and shred the meat. But in the Swenstad household, the lean, dense breasts are the prize.

The night before she took me and a photographer out turkey hunting, Ms. Swenstad cooked two breasts for a family get-together. One was about two pounds, harvested from a tom that her best friend’s husband had shot. The other was from a juvenile male called a jake. Her fiancé, Taylor Hayes, had shot it in the spring.

Mr. Hayes (also a firefighter) didn’t grow up in a hunting family, but when he fell in love with Ms. Swenstad, it became a “when in Rome” situation.

“He’s slowly getting into it because it’s all we talk about,” said Ms. Swenstad’s brother, Kyle.

The turkey breasts had been soaking in buttermilk for days. Ms. Swenstad cut them into two-inch chunks and seasoned them well with a commercial spice blend heavy on garlic, onion, paprika and chili powder. She wrapped them in bacon. Some were secured with a toothpick. Others were threaded on skewers with onion and bell pepper.

Her father, Howard, cooked the kebabs on a Charbroil Big Easy in the garage. Mr. Hayes sizzled the turkey-bacon bites on a Blackstone grill in the driveway.

All of it was nearly gone before Ms. Swenstad set out the main event: venison stew made from her mother’s recipe, which is punched up with Worcestershire and soy sauce.

After a round of baked apples with ice cream and a few more hunting stories — including one involving her father, a crossbow and a 700-pound elk whose head ended up hanging in their foyer — we headed off to sleep.

Rising before dawn, we made our way across a field on her uncle’s 114-acre farm. The trick was to be in place before the turkeys woke up and fluttered down from the trees to have breakfast.

“I just like being out here in God’s country,” Ms. Swenstad said as we worked our way to the blind in the dark. “It brings you this inner peace you can’t find anywhere else.”

Then we had to be quiet. Turkeys can see and hear really well.

The sun came up. The turkeys started to gobble softly. Nine hens pecked their way toward us from the tree line.

One wandered close enough to the blind to get a clean shot. Ms. Swenstad pushed the barrel of her gun through a canvas flap and pulled the trigger.

She tagged her turkey, slung it over her shoulder and started the walk back to the car. She’d dress it at home. But even this close to Thanksgiving, it wouldn’t end up on the Swenstad holiday table.

They never eat turkey on Thanksgiving, she said.

“We like ham.”

Employers lock out longshore workers in Montreal after contract offer rejected
The Maritime Employers Association is calling on federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon to intervene to resolve the impasse at Canada’s second-biggest port.

MONTREAL - Operations at the Port of Montreal were greatly reduced Monday as the Maritime Employers Association made good on a threat to lock out nearly 1,200 longshore workers if they didn’t accept what it called a final contract offer.

The lockout took effect at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and the employers’ association is asking federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon to intervene. MacKinnon’s office issued a statement Monday calling on both sides at the country’s second largest port to get back to the negotiating table.

“The parties must understand the urgency of the situation and do the work necessary to reach an agreement,” his office said. “Canadians are counting on them.”

The union told a news conference on Monday it is ready to return to the table as early as Tuesday. But Michel Murray, an adviser with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents the dock workers, said union overtures have received no response from the employer.

Murray told a news conference simultaneous lockouts in Montreal and Vancouver seem designed to force the federal government’s hand. Port workers in British Columbia are locked out amid a labour dispute involving more than 700 longshore supervisors, resulting in a paralysis of container cargo traffic at terminals across Canada’s west coast.

“We hope that the employer side will emerge from its silence of the past three weeks,” Murray said. “But clearly, when we look at what is happening, the lockout in Vancouver, the lockout in Montreal, we feel that it is a co-ordinated, planned attempt to increase the pressure on the federal government so that it intervenes in our file.”

Julie Gascon, CEO of the Montreal Port Authority, warned of “catastrophic” economic consequences of a prolonged conflict.

“This lockout affects not only the 1,200 longshoremen directly impacted by the work stoppage, but it also impacts over 10,000 workers in the logistics sector, from trucking and railway employees to maritime agents and pilots,” she said in a statement.

“Logistics jobs are the first to be affected, which inevitably sets off a domino effect throughout the entire economy in the markets we serve.”

Gascon told reporters in an early morning news conference effects will trickle down to other parts of the economy. “Today the conflict is impacting the supply chain, but tomorrow the conflict will impact factories as well, after that, it will be retailers,” she said.

The Port of Montreal, which moves nearly $400 million in goods every day, said essential services will continue, with liquid bulk terminals and the grain terminal among those remaining open.

The employers association in Montreal said it initiated the lockout after the unionized workers voted almost unanimously to reject a contract offer tabled last week. The workers have been without a collective agreement since Dec. 31 and had rejected two previous offers.

The employer said last week its latest offer included a three-per-cent salary increase each year for four years and a 3.5 per cent increase for the two subsequent years. The employer said the increases offered would bring a longshore worker’s total average compensation to more than $200,000 per year at the end of the six-year contract.

The union, the Syndicat des débardeurs du port de Montréal, called the figure exaggerated. It said the employer is focused on salaries, but what members want are improvements in scheduling and work-life balance. Members who are parents do not want to have stretches where they work 19 out of 21 days, it said.

Murray said it’s time to put those previous offers — which clearly cannot be the basis of any agreement — in the “shredder” and discuss what it will take for both sides to enter into a long-term agreement.

The Conseil du patronat, which represents Quebec employers, said it is very concerned about the latest work stoppage. It and a group representing manufacturers called on the federal government to intervene.

“Businesses and citizens can no longer bear the cost of this situation, which is repeated too often,” the Conseil du patronat said in a statement.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 11, 2024.

WARMINGTON: Lest we forget Canada's history of slavery, settlement, discrimination
Sacrifice of Canadian troops came second on Remembrance Day at Old City Hall Cenotaph

Lest we forget our fallen troops.

However, not until you are taught a lesson in past racism, land settlement and slavery.

Even on Remembrance Day at Toronto’s Cenotaph honouring the war fallen who gave Canada its freedoms, the event couldn’t begin without a reminder of what could perhaps be the reason you don’t see many people wearing poppies in 2024.

It took a while to get around to the sacrifice of Canadian troops. There were other matters to attend to first. Namely Canadians are “settlers” who engaged in “slavery” and “discrimination.”

As it said in the program, “MC Aretha Phillip, chief of protocol for the City of Toronto, brings remarks including the territorial land acknowledgment.”

It lasted three minutes.

“I would like to begin by acknowledging the Indigenous people of these lands,” Phillip said. “It’s important that we reaffirm our commitment and responsibility to improving relations between nations and learning about the rich history of this land to better understand our role as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers in this place we each call home.”

“The City of Toronto acknowledges the land we are meeting on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. We also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit. We also acknowledge the Williams treaties, signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.

“The City of Toronto also acknowledges all treaty peoples including those who came here as settlers, as migrants either in this generation or generations past including those of us who came here involuntarily, particularly those brought to these lands as a result of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. We pay tribute to ancestors of African origin and descent. In keeping with this tribute during this remembrance week, the city commemorated the contribution of No. 2 Construction Battalion, Canada’s only all-Black battalion. Despite facing discrimination, these brave men took up the call to serve during the First World War more than 100 years ago and we are joined today by their descendants.”

Phillip also said “our commemoration is a point of reflection on the past, providing context for the present challenges faced by Black communities and a hopeful future for all people of African descent.”

Spadina–Fort York Independent MP and naval reserve officer Kevin Vuong couldn’t believe his ears.

“This is the second Remembrance Day ceremony under Olivia Chow,” he said. “When my wife and I attended last year’s ceremony, we could not believe what we were hearing.

“Slavery was abolished in 1834, which was 33 years before Canada was even founded. Yet on a day that we were to honour our fallen, brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of our country and the freedoms we enjoy today, our city’s leaders told us that we should be ashamed.

“They also disgracefully rushed through the wreath laying and had all elected and diplomatic officials go up at once instead of giving each of us the time to lay a wreath and pay our respects, as is tradition. I was hoping it was a one-time error, but it’s clear this is the new city policy. Under Olivia Chow, our once sacred traditions are being replaced by a radical ideology and self-flagellating narrative.”

The whole day across the country seemed to be filled with veiled and not-so-veiled shots at Canadiana.

As my colleague Warren Kinsella reported on X, there were masked pro-Palestine supporters who interrupted the ceremony in Kingston. As well, Ottawa-area MPP Lisa MacLeod reported that at Sir Robert Borden High School in the nation’s capital, they played a “song in Arabic which did not follow the Royal Canadian Legion protocol” and “distressed Jewish students.”

Kinsella called it “madness.”

Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow didn’t pull any of that kind of nonsense. The problem was it took at while to get to the elected chief magistrate because the unelected protocol person had the microphone for so long.

Chow also offered a shout-out to the non-combat construction battalion that certainly deserves a pat on the back for its contribution to helping win the First World War with the logs they cut and trenches they helped build.

“Their story,” Chow said, is a “powerful reminder of the resilience and strength that diversity bring to our armed forces … despite facing discrimination these brave men took up the call to serve.”

Chow also mentioned Toronto’s premier combat unit, the 48th Highlanders, those who stormed the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago and the service of those who served and died in Afghanistan — eight of whom were from Toronto including fallen Cpl. Matthew McCully, whose mother Valerie McGrady laid a wreath.

There were many emotional moments like that, including veteran military officer Adrienne Batra, the editor-in-chief at the Toronto Sun, also laying a wreath. Emily Cathcart brought a photo of the grandfather she never met, Lloyd Simpson, who worked on Morse code in England in the Second World War, and Michael Harrison, whose dad Ivor joined the navy from Belfast at 16 before coming to Canada after the war and staying here until his death in 2018 at the age of 89.

“My dad and I always came here on Remembrance Day,” said Harrison.

They still do.

But if you look at the crowds at these ceremonies now compared to the past, it’s clear interest in our fallen soldiers is depleting. On the way to this year’s ceremony at Old City Hall, I noticed on the roads and on trains and at Union Station how few people wear poppies.

“It’s sure not like it was in the 1950s,” said Don Cherry, who was fired from television for asking people to wear them.

Lest we forget? Seems many already have.

Blue state Democrats issue scathing reflection on election loss: 'We're out of touch'
Both Dems criticized Democratic Party's association with 'elites'

Two blue state Democrats in Congress issued blistering assessments of where their party stands after Tuesday night’s overwhelming election defeat and offered suggestions about changes that Democrats need to make.

"That was a cataclysm," Connecticut Sen. Chis Murphy posted on X. "Electoral map wipeout. Senate D practical ceiling is now 52 seats. R's is 62."

"Time to rebuild the left," Murphy wrote. "We are out of touch with the crisis of meaning/purpose fueling MAGA. We refuse to pick big fights. Our tent is too small."

In a lengthy X thread that had more than 7 million views on Monday morning, Murphy said Democrats "don't listen enough; we tell people what's good for them" and skip "past the way people are feeling (alone, impotent, overwhelmed) and straight to uninspiring solutions (more roads! bulk drug purchasing!) that do little to actually upset the status quo of who has power and who doesn't."

Murphy acknowledged a disconnect between everyday working class voters and the "elites" and suggested the party needs to more openly embrace candidates who reject the status quo. 

"And when progressives like Bernie aggressively go after the elites that hold people down, they are shunned as dangerous populists," Murphy wrote. "Why? Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base."

"We cannot be afraid of fights – especially with the economic elites who have profited off neoliberalism. The right regularly picks fights with elites – Hollywood, higher ed, etc. Democrats (e.g. the Harris campaign) are tepid in our fights with billionaires and corporations."

Murphy told his followers that "real economic populism should be our tentpole."

"Those are hard things for the left," Murphy wrote in the final post of the thread. "A firm break with neoliberalism. Listen to poor and rural people, men in crisis. Don't decide for them. Pick fights. Embrace populism. Build a big tent. Be less judgmental. But we are beyond small fixes."

New York Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan, who won re-election in New York’s 18th Congressional District despite the red wave that swept across most of the country, also put forward a post-mortem on social media that was seen by millions of users.

"First and foremost, if you're using the words ‘moderate’ or ‘progressive’ you're missing the whole f***ing point," Ryan wrote on X. "It's not ideological. It's about who fights for the people vs. who further empowers and enables the elites."

Ryan explained his take on why he was able to win as a Democrat in a pro-Republican climate and said he "put affordability front and center every day."

"Most importantly, I told folks exactly who it was that was ripping them off, and I grounded it locally. It's the billionaires and big corporations making record-breaking profits while the rest of us struggle."

Ryan wrote, "It's not enough to throw these seemingly disparate policies at people. We must articulate a unifying principle, and clearly tell folks who’s at fault.  For me, it was Freedom. and Patriotism. And the fault lies with the same elites, in both parties, who've run this country for far too long."

Various camps within the Democratic Party have been pointing fingers at each other Democrat presidential candidate Vice President Harris' loss to President-elect Donald Trump last week.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pinned blame for the loss on the Democratic Party for "abandoning" the working class, sparking a rebuke from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change," Sanders posted to X last week, accompanied by a press release on the election results. "And they’re right."

Pelosi responded that the party has not left the working class behind in favor of kowtowing to "big-money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party," as Sanders had argued in his press release. 

"With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families. That's where we are," Pelosi told the New York Times' "The Interview" podcast on Saturday.

Press Freedom Groups Warn of the Threat Posed by Trump
Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s reelection “marks a dangerous moment for American journalism and global press freedom.”

Press freedom groups have a stark warning for Americans: Trump could pose a serious threat to fact-based journalism during his next term in office if he does not change course.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and Freedom of the Press Foundation all issued statements in the aftermath of Trump’s win this week, urging the ex- and soon-to-be president and his administration to commit to respecting the free press during the next four years. “Attacking the press is really an attack on American citizens’ right to know,” Reporters Without Borders Executive Director Clayton Weimers said in a statement. “Trump’s new administration can and must change its tune with the media and take concrete steps to protect journalists and develop a climate conducive to a robust and pluralistic news media.”

This will be a tall order for Trump: At a rally just last weekend, he said he would be OK with a crowd of journalists being shot at, as I reported at the time. His communications director, Steven Cheung, tried to clean up his comments by implausibly alleging that Trump “was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!” From early September until the end of October, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times, Reporters Without Borders found in an analysis published last month. Trump has repeatedly derided journalists as “fake news” and the media as “the enemy of the people.” And as my colleague Pema Levy reported, Trump also launched what experts said was a frivolous lawsuit against CBS News last month, alleging that producers unfairly edited a 60 Minutes interview with his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, to make her look better. His campaign also submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission claiming that the Washington Post was running a paid advertising campaign to boost stories critical of Trump; a Post spokesperson said the allegations were “improper” and “without merit.” CNN also reported that Trump has called at least 15 times for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks he dislikes.

All this makes it no wonder, then, that Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s reelection “marks a dangerous moment for American journalism and global press freedom.” The Committee to Protect Journalists struck a similar tone. “Legal persecution, imprisonment, physical violence, and even killings have sadly become familiar threats for journalists across the world,” its statement said. “They must not now also become commonplace in the United States, where threats of violence and online harassment have in recent years become routine.” And Freedom of the Press Foundation claimed that Trump “will try to destroy press freedom”; as the group noted, Trump will have an ally in Elon Musk, who has spread pro-Trump disinformation on his platform to the tune of billions of views in the lead-up to Election Day. More recently, Musk has taken to telling everyday X users that they are the media now and “citizen journalism is the future.” (Apparently his conception of journalism sees conspiracy theories as acceptable and fact-checks as unnecessary.)

This all comes at a time when Republicans, and young people, are as likely to trust social media as a news source as they are to trust national news outlets, according to data published last month from Pew Research Center. The Trump campaign and the GOP have both contributed to and capitalized on this distrust, with Trump launching his own social media network, Truth Social, in 2022, and eschewing the cable news sit-downs Harris did during the campaign for interviews with right-wing male podcasters, who likely helped him make massive gains among young men this year. Media outlets hoping to win back the trust of these voters, though, will not just have podcasters and social media to compete with: One of their biggest adversaries will likely be Trump himself.

Spokespeople for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions from Mother Jones on Sunday.

HUNTER: Why did accused teens in Ken Lee slaying opt for judge-alone?
It was a particularly brutal, shocking murder. Accenting the horror was the age and gender of the suspected killers.

Article content
There were eight of them, girls, aged 13 to 16, and they were allegedly on a mission of mayhem.

Nearly two years after the mobbing attack that left 59-year-old homeless man Kenneth Lee dead, the matter is still making its way through the courts.

Toronto cops said Lee was swarmed and then stabbed to death near Union Station over defending a friend who was guarding her bottle of booze.

Four of the youths have since pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the case: Three to manslaughter and one to assault causing bodily harm.

Next year, the remaining quartet will stand trial. Three are dealing with second-degree murder charges and the outlier is charged with manslaughter. Each have all pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.

Trump’s border czar to critics: ‘Legal immigrants are perfectly safe’ 
Tom Homan, President-elect Trump’s pick for “border czar” in his upcoming administration, pushed back against critics of his immigration ideology.

Fox Business’s Elizabeth MacDonald showed recent clips featuring MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace saying Homan has “ties to Project 2025,” former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro saying he has “a cowboy attitude” and that Trump’s deportation plan will “require a lot of pushback” and “The View” co-host Ana Navarro saying “when he says ‘Yes, families can be deported together,’ what he is saying, is that U.S. citizens can be deported.”

“Are you saying that, Tom?” MacDonald asked Homan on “The Evening Edit,” referring to Navarro’s statement.

Homan responded that “U.S. citizens” and “legal immigrants are perfectly safe, for God’s sakes.”

Late last month, in response to a question from journalist Cecilia Vega on CBS’s “60 Minutes” about the possibility of going forward with “mass deportation without separating families,” Homan said “there is” and that “Families can be deported together.”

Earlier in his interview on “The Evening Edit,” Homan said the Biden administration has “deported families together.”

“I mean, look … if these people demand due process, they demand the right to claim asylum, they demand the right [to see a judge], and we give them to ‘em at an [exorbitant] taxpayer cost, at the end of that due process, if [a] federal judge [says] ‘You must go home,’ they have to go home,” Homan added. “If they don’t, then what the hell are we doing?”

In the elated ‘Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,’ every seat is the best seat in the house
It opens with a clock counting down until show time — the dropped stomach, rollercoaster slowly encroaching its apex sensation — and then, a gentle fake out. Taylor Swift is heard before she is seen. “It’s been a long time...” her voice carries. Then the drop hits: an abridged performance of “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince” into “Cruel Summer,” a track that TikTok breathed new life into four years after its initial release on her 2019 album “Lover.”

It opens with a clock counting down until show time — the dropped stomach, rollercoaster slowly encroaching its apex sensation — and then, a gentle fake out. Taylor Swift is heard before she is seen. “It’s been a long time...” her voice carries. Then the drop hits: an abridged performance of “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince” into “Cruel Summer,” a track that TikTok breathed new life into four years after its initial release on her 2019 album “Lover.”

This is the moment it should become clear: “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” film is a near exact replica of her blockbuster concert performance, which recaps all 10 of her studio albums across 17 years of recorded work. There will be no narrative breaks, no behind-the-scenes footage, no additional ornamentation of the monolithic set (with the exception of a few CGI effects and album title cards to introduce each epoch.) The film delivers on the promise of its title: this is the Eras Tour in full — conveniently viewable at an AMC theater near you.

For those who’ve managed to snag tickets to the Eras Tour concert, it is the ability to relive the experience, likely with loved ones who weren’t as lucky. For those who didn’t attend, it’s a chance to test expectations versus reality. But for everyone, it is the opportunity to have every seat in the house transform into the best seat in the house. “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is all up close and personal footage from every vantage point, courtesy of Sam Wrench, who shot and directed it.

Where else but in this film can you be placed inches from Swift’s moss-covered “evermore” album -era piano as she introduces “Champagne Problems” — so close as to examine phalanges as they press down on the final notes of the song’s coda? And where else does it sound this good, highlighting sonic details that might’ve been missed in the stadium setting? Like guitars placed high in the mix on “Look What You Made Me Do,” differing slightly from the recording, or emphasis placed on moments fans have transformed into opportunities from insider participation, like when everyone shouts, “1, 2, 3, 4, let’s go, bitch!” in “Delicate,” as inspired by a viral video?

Edits to the three-and-a-half-hour concert production are few on screen. Costume changes are cut down. Some songs are snipped, like “The Archer,” “Cardigan,” “Wildest Dreams,” and “no body no crime.” The “Speak Now” section is just one song long: “Enchanted,” with “Long Live” soundtracking the end credits alongside images of “Eras Tour” bloopers and an endless exchange of friendship bracelets. On stage banter, too, is limited, mostly reserved for humor and exposition.

As previously reported, the concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million.

AMC announced that the concert film broke its record for highest ticket sales revenue in a single day. The theater chain Cinemark reported domestic pre-sale records are more than “10 times higher pre-sales than any other cinema engagement event.”

It’s too early to tell, but all signs point to her usurping 2011’s “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never” as the biggest concert film, ever. And for the premiere Wednesday night in Los Angeles, Swift shut down The Grove, a bustling mall just south of Hollywood, and watched her performance in an auditorium alongside a star-studded audience of Adam Sandler, Mariska Hargitay, actor Julia Garner, “Queer Eye” co-host Karamo Brown, country star Maren Morris, singer Hayley Kiyoko and Bachelor Nation’s Becca Tilley.

It is massive, but nothing could exactly recreate the decibel-bursting exhilaration of a live music performance, particularly one at this scale. But in this format, Swift gets as close as possible — and for her, being an exception to the rule is par for the course. In a fractured, algorithmic music industry, Swift is a final exemplar of monoculture, a figure recognizable by most. And because of that fact, she’s able to fully communicate her power in a concert film with little to no dialogue.

(That, admittedly, is something available to only her and Beyoncé, a superstar Swift has learned from and mirrored, in some ways. For example: Beyoncé limits traditional press appearances to instead present her own story in her own terms; Swift has begun to do the same. Relatedly, Bey will release a documentary chronicling her Renaissance World Tour, premiering at AMC theaters in North America on Dec. 1 in a similar agreement to Swift.)

The success of Swift’s concert film, too, has something to do with the setting of a theater. Her revealing 2020 documentary, “Miss Americana,” was released to Netflix and meant to be absorbed with a kind of intimacy. The viewer is with her in the backseat of car, listening to her incredible candor about the pressures of being Swift, and in a particularly memorable moment, disordered eating.

A very different viewing experience, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is meant to be enjoyed communally — a shout-along affair where fans in bespoke cosplay can dance and sing and film the screen on their smartphones, breaking the rules of the traditional movie-going experience. Strangers become friends. And all the while, feeling closer to Swift than ever before.

“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” an AMC release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for some strong language and suggestive material. Running time: 168 minutes. Three stars out of four.

Are you ready for it Toronto? City looks for a ‘real lift’ from Taylor Swift dates
Toronto is already planning for November when Swifties will descend on the city, bringing traffic congestion and an economic shot in the arm.

Are you ready for it, Toronto? Not yet, city officials say, but they are already planning for Taylor Swift’s six shows in November to ensure that the pop megastar helps local businesses shake off any lingering pandemic doldrums.

Work is underway on everything from traffic to transit to maximizing the kind of economic benefits that her record-shattering Eras tour has already brought to cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.

“City divisions and agencies are in the early stages of planning for (traffic) congestion and crowd management around the Rogers Centre for Taylor Swift’s Toronto concerts in November,” a city spokesperson told the Star this week in a statement. “The city will leverage its existing event traffic management plans for the Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena area, which help to ensure safe and orderly movement around major events at those venues.”

The TTC confirmed it has plans to boost service, with details to be finalized this summer.

Economic development officials, meanwhile, are hurrying to help private operators already cashing in on Swift-mania.

“We’re seeing the market respond a lot already,” with Eras-themed listening and dance parties, a candlelit tribute, special screenings of her concert film and hotel promotions, said Pat Tobin, the city’s general manager of economic development and culture.

Toronto activities around the U.S. singer-songwriter’s visit are only expected to grow as she releases an album next month and continues a globe-trotting tour that has already grossed more than $1 billion.

“The city will work across multiple fronts,” to help firms, still shaking off pandemic doldrums, leverage big-spending “Swifties” arriving from around the world for the Rogers Centre shows Nov. 14 through Nov. 16 and Nov. 21 through Nov. 23, Tobin said.

U.S. cities that have already hosted the star reported measurable impacts beyond those for normal sold-out shows. Economists recently upgraded Singapore’s economic outlook, crediting in part the impacts of a six-night stand ending Saturday and secured with payments by the Singaporean government in return for Swift not performing elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

Coun. Shelley Carroll, vice-chair of the city committee that oversees economic development, said city staff are planning for a swelling of the downtown population and resulting logistics, including how to ensure emergency vehicles can get to fainting fans.

“It’s a bit like planning for TIFF,” she said, referring to the international film festival that dominates downtown for part of every September.

“We are happy to know that hospitality business and other sectors will get a real lift,” said Carroll, while bemoaning the fact that, unlike most big U.S. cities being visited by Swift, Toronto does not have the power to impose its own sales tax to financially benefit directly from spending generated by the music phenomenon’s stay.

The federal and provincial governments will split $52 in HST from each $400 hotel bill, she noted, while Toronto, still in the grips of a pandemic-triggered budget crisis, bears attendant concert costs but gets no tax revenue.

“We need a Taylor tax and we need it swiftly,” added Carroll.

Andrew Weir, executive vice-president of tourism promotion agency Destination Toronto, noted that the local shows will give businesses a boost during a traditionally slow time, between the summer and holiday seasons.

“In a lot of respects, it’s not unlike other major concert tours that also draw,” Weir said. “This one just seems to have catapulted to another level. It has captured the world’s imagination as a must-attend event.

“Many businesses will offer special packages or programming to connect to the momentum of the tour and we will help consolidate that into a story about how to have a big Toronto experience in November.”

Tony Abbo, traffic engineer for Glendale, Arizona, where Swift kicked off her tour last year, said the challenge was different than managing gridlock from a big sporting event because almost nobody left the site early.

“Everybody will be there until the very last song and then a human wave will come out and that’s when your challenge starts,” Abbo said in an interview, adding that one lesson he learned was to ensure taxis, Uber, Lyft and other services have enough drivers to get the Swifties where they need to go.

Not enough drivers returned to the stadium to pick up second rides, leaving some concertgoers stranded, with Glendale police officers staying to watch out for the younger crowd, Abbo said. “In the end, everybody got home.”

Architectural Digest uncovered one Swift impact that Toronto, suffering a housing affordability crisis, might hope to avoid.

The magazine analyzed home prices in cities visited by the Eras tour and found that they increased more than the U.S. national average, likely due to visiting fans who liked what they saw and decided to relocate.

Taylor Swift was consulted in Rogers Centre renovations ahead of her upcoming Eras Tour. Here’s what Swifties will see
The Blue Jays have poured hundreds of millions into modernizing the Rogers Centre. But rest assured, Swifties: these changes were made with you in mind.

The Blue Jays are spending close to $400 million to renovate the Rogers Centre. Not a dollar was spent without considering some of the stadium’s biggest customers — not those cheering on the Blue Jays, but those who will be streaming through the gates for six nights later this year: Swifties.

Taylor Swift is bringing her Eras Tour — the first tour to bring in more than $1 billion (U.S.) — to the Rogers Centre in November, an event that already has city officials planning for the economic windfall it is expected to create. Concert attendees will be greeted by new seats and sightlines, all thanks to the millions the Blue Jays have poured into modernizing the Rogers Centre.

But rest assured, Swifties: these changes were made with you in mind.

“Even though we built this as a ballpark first, we want to have these big concerts and we would be silly not to,” Marnie Starkman, the Blue Jays’ executive vice president of business operations, said Thursday when the renovations were unveiled. “We’ve been working with Taylor and her team and the stage sits the same way that it would sit (before).”

That’s in centre field, away from the infield to protect the playing surface. While that’s not changing, the view of the stage is.

The renovations this off-season — part of a multi-year overhaul of the ballpark led by PCL Construction — were targeted at the 100-level seating bowl. PCL began demolition of the entire lower bowl on Oct. 13, then began construction on the new foundation on Oct. 26.

The big addition is new field-level premium clubs that lead to the 1,600 seats located directly behind home plate. Those clubs won’t be finished for another three months and the ballpark has no concerts scheduled until the end of June to allow construction to wrap up.

What will the renovations mean for Taylor Swift fans? 
Relevant to Swifties, however, is the smaller change at field level: the replacement and reorientation of all seats from foul pole to foul pole. Sections down the left- and right-field lines, which were previously pointed toward the outfield — where Swift’s stage will be — are now angled to the infield.

For Starkman, that’s not a concern.

“Most concerts, people don’t sit in their seats,” Starkman said. “We talked to a lot of different ballparks and ballparks are like, ‘You do not need to worry about someone in the 100 level being slightly angled.’ That was honestly not a concern for us.”

And while the view of ball games from some seats will be obstructed, with rising walls in the outfield corners blocking plays there from fans, there are no new obstructions for Swift fans to worry about.

Taylor Swift Eras Tour logistics taken into consideration
What was a concern were the logistics of hosting the most lucrative concert tour the world has ever seen. Planners needed to maintain truck access to the field through a gate in the centre field wall, as well as the 360-degree ring road in the skeleton of field level. Without it, moving Swift’s stage into and out of the ballpark would have been impossible.

“Taylor Swift obviously has the largest amount of vehicles coming in and out, so we wanted to make sure that we could provide (for) that,” said Sanj Perera, the director of project management for the renovations.

But Perera still insists “it’s baseball-first” with the renovations — and Mark Shapiro, president and CEO of the Blue Jays, doubles down on that. The renovations were meant to turn an aging, multipurpose stadium into a dedicated ballpark, Shapiro said.

Just know, Swifties, that part of it was designed with you in mind.

No concert ticket? No problem — Swifties can still gather at ‘Taylgate’ in Toronto
TORONTO - Come one Swiftie, come all Swifties.

TORONTO - Come one Swiftie, come all Swifties.

Whether you were lucky to nab tickets to one of Taylor Swift’s six sold-out Toronto concerts in November or not, a new “fan experience” hopes to get you into the party spirit.

Organizers behind Toronto’s Version: Taylgate ‘24 said Monday they will unite Swifties of all ages for an unabashed celebration of the tortured poet, providing an indoor space for young fans to congregate before her concerts.

The event will include a live DJ mixing Swift’s hits, sing-along spaces for the vocally brave and a “massive” space to create friendship bracelets.

Swift is scheduled to play Toronto’s Rogers Centre across two weekends, from Nov. 14 to 16 and Nov. 21 to 23. The Taylgate event will run daily on those dates from 1 p.m. until 11 p.m. at the nearby Metro Toronto Convention Centre.

Event co-producer Bram Goldstein credits his two teenage daughters for inspiring the idea, saying they wanted to meet with other Swift fans while staying out of the chilly weather and early winter sundown.

He says Taylgate will offer a “safe, indoor and accessible space” for young fans while their parents and older fans are also welcome. Tickets for all six dates are on sale for $55 at torontosversion.com.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 13, 2024.

Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour hits Toronto in November. Here’s everything you need to know
As we approach the long-awaited concert weekends, here is a guide to all things “Tayronto.”

In less than three months, Toronto will “trade (its) baseball cap for a crown” when global superstar Taylor Swift brings her record-smashing Eras Tour to the city for six sold-out shows at Rogers Centre this November.

The four-time album-of-the-year Grammy winner’s expected presence in Toronto had the Rogers Centre implementing renovations with Swifties in mind and city officials planning away in preparation.

The city will be welcoming her by designating the path between Nathan Phillips Square and the arena “Taylor Swift Way” for the month of November, continuing the trend of cities around the world honouring a visit from the pop star.

As we approach the long-awaited concert weekends — which fans have lovingly dubbed “Tayronto” — here is everything you need to know:

The basics
When are the Toronto Taylor Swift shows?
The Eras Tour is coming to Toronto for two weekends with three nights each Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Swift will be playing Rogers Centre with opener Gracie Abrams from Nov. 14 to 16 and Nov. 21 to 23.

She is set to become the first artist to perform six shows at Rogers Centre, but could the multi-hyphenate superstar possibly be doing even more? Reality can be “Sweeter Than Fiction.”

What songs will Taylor Swift perform in Toronto?
Swift is expected to give a breathtaking 10-act performance over three hours, which will include songs from almost all her studio albums or “eras.” Her debut album, “Taylor Swift” has remained conspicuously absent from the permanent set list.

Since the tour started in March 2023, the set list has gone through several changes, most notably after Swift released her 11th studio album “The Tortured Poets Department” in April. 

As of the singer’s latest show in London, England on Aug. 20, the set list includes 44 permanent songs each night. As Swift recently collaborated with Abrams for her new song — “us” — it is possible that Swift replaces a song on the set list with the new tune during the upcoming North American leg of the tour.

And, on top of that, every night Swift plays two songs which are not on the set list — one on acoustic guitar and the other on piano.

These songs have even included some of Swift’s non-album songs such as the country love ballad, “Crazier” from 2009 Disney Channel film, “Hannah Montana: The Movie” in which Swift cameoed, and have even on occasion included special guests performing a song on which they collaborated with her.

While initially, the rule was that the surprise songs would not be repeated (except for the ones from “Midnights” which had just been released the year before the tour started), during her Melbourne show on Feb. 18, Swift announced that she has abolished the no repeats rule. 

Also in Melbourne, Swift started playing mash-ups of two and sometimes even three songs for each of the two acoustic performances. So over six nights, Toronto can get anywhere between 12 to 36 surprise songs (although it is unlikely it would be that high — 24 is probably a safer bet).

Specially with the no repeats rule gone, it is hard to say which songs the city will get, but there is one song that may make its way because of its Toronto connection. 

For her song, “It’s Nice to Have a Friend” from her 2019 album “Lover,” Swift sampled a track featuring the then 9- to 18-year-old students of the city’s very own Regent Park School of Music. Licensing and publishing proceeds from the use of sample goes toward funding the school’s music program. Swift also made an additional undisclosed donation to the program on the album’s day of release in 2019.

How bad will traffic be for the Eras Tour in Toronto?
If you’re lucky enough to be heading to see Taylor, or unlucky enough to have to go through the area around the Rogers Centre on the day of a Swiftie swarm, you might want to plan ahead. Even artists performing in Toronto have had to get out of their cars and walk to their concerts — maybe you’ll catch sight of Swift walking down Lake Shore Boulevard?

The area around Rogers Centre continues to be heavily under construction — for both drivers and transit riders. Construction on the Gardiner is expected to continue through all of the days of Swift’s shows in Toronto. A study in June found that morning rush hour travel times on the Gardiner had increased by more than 250 per cent, which might not bode well for concertgoers hoping to make their way downtown by car.

Meanwhile, Queen Street, between Victoria and Bay Streets, remains shut down for Ontario Line construction and the Spadina streetcars has been replaced with buses — which after heavy congestion in the first month, now have a priority bus lane.

But don’t fret, city officials told the Star in March that they would be finalizing plans this summer to help manage the expected influx of concertgoers with plans for traffic and increased TTC service.

Where can I stay if I’m coming from out of town?
Hundreds of thousands of Taylor Swift fans have secured their coveted tickets for the tail end of the pop singer’s Eras tour in Toronto this fall. But where will they sleep?

For the most part, nowhere cheap, hospitality experts and short-term rental data indicate.

While November has historically been a quiet month in Toronto with fewer events, fewer bookings and lower rates for both hotels and short-term rentals, the “Taylor effect” — a term coined by economists to describe the impact of her concerts on local markets — is already shaking off that reputation with demand for accommodations driving up daily rates.

The average daily rate of short-term rentals across Toronto is up roughly 70 per cent for duration of Swift’s six-concert residency at the Rogers Centre compared to same time in 2023, according to AirDNA, a company that supplies data on the short-term rental market including Airbnb and VRBO. That translates to roughly $350 per night for Swift’s six concert dates in November compared to $208 for the same nights last year.

Toronto, which is one of only two Canadian stops on Swift’s tour, has seen a 1,200 per cent surge in short-term rental searches linked to the singer’s concert dates, Airbnb reported. The company said it will release more detailed booking and supply data in a few weeks.

How much money is Eras expected to bring to Toronto?
Toronto tourism still hasn’t bounced back to pre-pandemic levels but there’s one last hope for this year: Taylor Swift.

Economists upgraded Singapore’s economic outlook in March, credited in part to the impacts of six-nights of Swifties, secured with payments by the Singaporean government in return for Swift not performing elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

We’ve already seen the beginnings of Swift’s economic boon for the city — just days after Swift announced her Toronto tour dates, flight searches on Expedia for her Nov. 14 to 16 tour dates jumped by more than 5,000 per cent, and hotel searches went up by more than 8,000 per cent, according to the travel agency. 

No ticket? No problem
How much are Toronto Eras tickets?
All six Eras Tour nights in Toronto are sold-out with fans travelling far and wide to catch the world’s biggest superstar on stage. Some resale tickets are going for as high as $121,000 on the resale market.

If you were wait-listed by Ticketmaster, then you may still have a shot at being “The Lucky One” — for some of the previous shows, fans were taken off the wait-list for additional tickets as late as the weekend before the concert.

However, some fans have been using social media to buy and sell tickets at face-value, but that comes with its own risk of possible scammers

What if I didn’t get a ticket?
In many cities with open stadiums, fans without tickets got together outside the stadium to enjoy the show and in Munich, over 20,000 fans assembled at a hill just outside the stadium to experience the Eras Tour. Unfortunately, Rogers Centre in November will probably not have an open roof but there are still events that Toronto Swifties can attend to have “The Best Day” even if they don’t have tickets.

On all six concert dates, “Toronto’s Version: Taylgate ‘24” will be running from 1 p.m. until 11 p.m. at the nearby Metro Toronto Convention Centre and will include will include a live DJ mixing Swift’s hits, singalong spaces for the vocally brave and a massive space to create friendship bracelets.

Organizers of Taylor Swift Dance Party Canada have also planned after-parties for all six nights at the Antler Room at The Loose Moose on Front Street from 11 p.m. till 2 a.m. the next day.

A New Set of Gits Releases Gives Mia Zapata Her Voice Back
The Seattle frontwoman was killed in 1993, as her punk band was on the cusp of a breakthrough. Remastered recordings provide a chance to rewrite her story.

Here’s how I wish the story of the Gits could be told: Four hardworking musicians finally escaped the grind of underpaid gigs and indie recordings and followed such compadres as Nirvana to global fame, led by the poetic howls of Mia Zapata, heiress apparent to Janis Joplin and Patti Smith.

Here’s the story you may already know, as told by shows including “Unsolved Mysteries” and “Forensic Files," and the documentary “The Gits”: Talented singer found raped and murdered on a Seattle street just as her band was on the cusp of success.

In an attempt to bring what might have been to life, the seminal Seattle label Sub Pop is releasing remastered recordings by the Gits on Nov. 13. While the band was together, Zapata, the bassist Matt Dresdner, the guitarist Andy Kessler (a.k.a. Joe Spleen) and the drummer Steve Moriarty released only one album of their complex thrash rock (Kessler calls it “five-chord punk”): “Frenching the Bully” (1992). Sub Pop’s digital releases will also include three LPs of unfinished recordings, early work and live tracks. In December a concert album, “Live at the X-Ray,” will arrive for the first time.

“It’s been a long, long road to get to where we are,” Dresdner, 57, said in a video interview from Seattle with Kessler. “There were decades through which I didn’t have the bandwidth or emotional strength to attack a project like this.” As the group worked to finally make its music available, a “secondary motivation” arose, he said. “Mia’s talent as a singer — the music we were able to make together — we hope will be the first sentence, moving forward.”

The Gits formed after Dresdner saw Zapata perform at an open mic at Antioch College, a small liberal arts school in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1986. “When we started the band, it was because I fell in love with Mia’s voice,” he said. “It was so beautiful and so powerful, and so intimate.”

Raised in Kentucky, Zapata told people she was related to the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, though this seems unlikely. She learned to play guitar and piano at 9, and was drawn to the emotive power of blues and punk. In spite of her affluent background, she chose a bohemian existence, working in bars and living in communal houses.

With the Gits, who became part of Seattle’s punk scene in 1989, Zapata was a formidable stage presence, singing her guts out in T-shirts and torn jeans, her hair usually blond and matted in dreadlocks. She drew and wrote in journals that often became the starting points for lyrics set to her bandmates’ propulsive music.

Zapata wrote about emotional struggle: depression, anger, guilt. “I see the same mistakes that I once made / All that I can tell you there is a price to pay,” she warns with a snarl in “Bob (Cousin O).” In “Spear and Magic Helmet” Zapata acts out a superhero fantasy of avenging a friend’s rape. But it wasn’t a fantasy, it was a message: She wrote the song to call out a local musician, according to a biography by Moriarty, “Mia Zapata & the Gits: A Story of Art, Rock, and Revolution,” published in August.

Her bandmates say Zapata used to joke that all her songs were about “the torment.” In life, she was different. “Most of the time she was hilarious,” Kessler, 57, said. “She had a lot of lightness.” The Gits, after all, were originally called the Sniveling Little Rat-Faced Gits, after a “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” skit.

By 1993 the Gits had certainly paid their dues and honed their sound. “Second Skin,” from “Bully,” captures the band’s intensity: The jazz-trained Moriarty’s snare leads with an urgent call to action. Kessler — Pete Townshend to Zapata’s Roger Daltrey — steps in to announce the harmonic structure, one stroke per bar. After Zapata launches her growled demand for protection from pain, Dresdner drops in, and the Gits are off. “I need a second skin / Something to hold me up / Can’t do it on my own,” Zapata sings, her strength — emotionally, vocally, and lyrically — propelling the raw recording.

Allison Wolfe’s band Bratmobile played with the Gits at the Jabberjaw in Los Angeles in June 1993. “We were cheering for them,” she said, remembering Zapata as serious and focused. “It was a very powerful show, very punk.”

Tim Sommer, an Atlantic Records representative who wanted to sign the Gits, was also at that show. Like many bands of the time, they were wary of the temptations of cash. But they were ready for a break. “We would have liked to not have to work [expletive] jobs,” Kessler said. “We would have loved to have had the opportunity to almost exclusively focus on being the Gits.”

Ten days later, Zapata’s strangled, beaten body was found. She was 27, and had been attacked after leaving the Comet Tavern around 2 a.m.

As part of the effort to reset the narrative, Moriarty’s book stops before this ending. But Zapata’s death is part of her story, just as violence against women is part of the narrative of American life.

For many women in the music industry — or just any woman living and working on her own — Zapata’s murder was a worst nightmare come true, the cautionary fate we had been warned about on our many nights out late, living independent lives. Friends, led by Valerie Agnew, the drummer for 7 Year Bitch, founded Home Alive, an organization offering self-defense classes. Wolfe’s mom paid for mother-daughter firearms lessons.

Rachel Flotard, a founder of the band Visqueen, moved to Seattle in 1994. “I was walking around with my guitar, going to practice, and on the same streets, in the same buildings,” she said. “For a woman in Seattle, the story of Mia Zapata was just part of the fabric, and part of how you took care of yourself as a woman in a band.”

The tragedy had a particularly devastating impact on Seattle, which was then a focus of international attention. The Gits were featured in the 1996 documentary “Hype,” about the impact of the “grunge” media frenzy. Because most sexual assaults are committed by people who know the victim, the investigation into Zapata’s attack focused on her friends and associates. “It tore their scene apart because they were suspecting each other,” Wolfe said.

The Gits played shows with Joan Jett as the frontwoman to raise money for an independent investigator. They participated in segments for crime shows that they saw as a necessary evil to keep the case alive. That pressure may have helped, finally, to resolve it. In 2003 a match registered in Florida for DNA found on Zapata’s body. A year later, Jesus Mezquia, a man with no apparent connection to Zapata, was convicted of her murder. He died in 2021 while serving his sentence.

It’s hard to imagine a more shocking end to a burgeoning band’s career. It took decades, and the illness of a friend, James Atkins of Hammerbox, for Dresdner, Kessler and Moriarty to even think of playing together again. In 2015 and 2016 they performed benefit shows for Atkins with Flotard on vocals. She recalled everyone being in tears by the end of the first song at their initial rehearsal together: “I learned and felt how much her bandmates loved her.”

The shows led to talk of getting the Gits’ music back in circulation, with the help of Flotard, who also manages bands. “We want to make sure that when we’re no longer on this Earth, this body of work that we made together is available,” Dresdner said. “We’ve been working closely with Mia’s family who’s really supportive and wants her legacy to be acknowledged and available to people.”

Flotard said she relished the opportunity turn the Gits’ music toward the future, rather than the past. “I wanted to treat this music and to treat the idea of listening to her sing as something to be celebrated and feel joy,” she said. “How wild all these years later would it be, in the age of streaming services and things that didn’t even exist, for her to have a new life and inspire anybody who was thinking about maybe getting up on a stage and playing? We have a lot of fighting coming up, and we need all of those fight songs.”

The Jazz-Metal Trio PainKiller’s Classic Lineup Revs Up Again
Mick Harris, Bill Laswell and John Zorn’s new album, “Samsara” — their first in 30 years — arrives as Laswell battles health troubles that “opened up a new direction.”

In the spring of 1991, John Zorn, the radically eclectic composer and saxophonist, hopped into a cab outside his East Village apartment. Already inside was Mick Harris, a young drummer visiting from Britain whose band, Napalm Death, had become the leading exemplar of grindcore, a caustic, velocity-crazed blend of punk and metal. Their destination: Greenpoint Studios, the Brooklyn headquarters of the prolific bassist-producer Bill Laswell, Zorn’s friend and collaborator.

There, in one day, the three bashed out a fully improvised record. Featuring Zorn’s convulsive alto sax over Laswell and Harris’s alternately blasting and lumbering rhythms — seasoned with vocal shrieks from Zorn and Harris — the album represented a new bridge between the jazz avant-garde and underground rock’s most forbidding extremes.

On Friday, Zorn’s Tzadik label will release “Samsara,” the first new studio recording in 30 years to feature the original lineup of the trio, collectively known as PainKiller. While the personnel is the same, much else is different this time around.

For one thing, the three musicians were never in the same room during the creation of the record. Harris — who has made electronic music for decades and gave up drumming entirely after PainKiller initially parted ways in 1998 — contributed synthetic beats recorded at home in England. Zorn overdubbed his saxophone parts at Orange Music, the New Jersey studio where Laswell shifted his operations in the late ’90s. And Laswell added bass last, via a makeshift mobile studio that his longtime engineer James Dellatacoma set up at his Upper Manhattan apartment.

The distance wasn’t just convenient but necessary during a period of profound personal struggle for Laswell. Since 2022, in addition to diabetes and high blood pressure, he has battled a blood infection, and problems with his heart, kidneys and lungs that have kept him in and out of the hospital, left him unable to walk and led to intense pain in his fingers, severely curtailing his playing. He and his team have also been fighting to stave off a possible eviction from Orange Music.

Yet the album’s eight tracks of immersive, richly textured beatscapes layered with volatile sax lines still feel unmistakably like PainKiller, joining the band’s catalog following “Execution Ground” from 1994, where the trio embraced desolate long-form dub and hallucinatory ambience.

“The important thing about PainKiller, and it’s still true today: It’s the most extreme sax-bass-drums group that ever existed,” Zorn, 71, said with good-natured relish, seated on a shady public green just north of the East Village one morning in early October.

In a phone interview from his apartment, Laswell, 69, highlighted the same quality as he reflected on the group’s return. “It was too long, and I’m glad it came back,” he said. “I hope something extreme can come out of it.”

On a video call from his home in Birmingham, Harris, 57, said he was “really chuffed” this past January when he received an email from Zorn proposing a new incarnation of PainKiller that would incorporate his electronics. “When Zorn first approached me, I thought, ‘Wow, is that actually going to work?’ And then my wife said, ‘Don’t overthink,’” he recalled. “‘If Zorn and Laswell think that this can work, Mick — well, not think, say it can work — you go with it. You can do this.’ So that’s good enough for me.”

A New Campaign Against Loneliness Starts With a Potluck

Everyone Else Is Giving a Standing Ovation. Do I Have To?
Mutual trust and admiration have always been key to PainKiller. Zorn and Laswell met in the late ’70s, and worked together on various early projects as each established himself as a force in the New York avant-garde. In the ’80s, Zorn’s omnivorous musical appetite led him to the hardcore scene that was thriving at CBGB, in his East Village backyard. One day, he stopped into a neighborhood record store and made a request of the clerk: “‘Pick out five hardcore, heavy records that have been on your turntable for months.’”

The haul included a compilation of Napalm Death’s live radio recordings, made at the request of the veteran BBC D.J. and tastemaker John Peel. Hyperaggressive sounds quickly made their way into Zorn’s work — including on “Spy vs Spy” from 1989, which featured pieces by Ornette Coleman, and in the riotously eclectic group Naked City — to the dismay of some jazz purists, whom he said regarded him as “the devil.”

Harris was already a fan of “Spy vs Spy,” enamored by its “barrage of sound,” when Zorn, then a frequent visitor to Japan, caught up with Napalm Death backstage before a 1989 Tokyo gig and proposed a collaboration. During his ’91 New York visit, he learned that Zorn was friends with Laswell. (The drummer loved his noise-jazz supergroup Last Exit.) After a quick phone call from Zorn to Laswell, who shared Zorn’s passion for the hardcore underground, the trio’s initial recording date was booked.

Harris remembers the session, tracked by the engineer Oz Fritz, as a whirlwind. “John tells Oz, ‘Just run the tapes.’ And John just said, ‘Yeah, Mick, just do what you do,’” he recalled, laughing at the briskness with which it unfolded. “Before you knew it, it was done!” Bluntly evocative titles and grisly photographs — chosen, Zorn said, for their “dichotomy of beauty and violence,” in the mode of the philosopher Georges Bataille — framed both the debut and later PainKiller efforts as unsettling art objects.

James Plotkin, a multi-instrumentalist who collaborated with both Harris and Zorn in the ’90s, and has played in influential experimental-metal projects such as Khanate, attended the first PainKiller session and felt inspired by what the group represented. “I was looking for music like that, and it didn’t exist,” he said. “Once somebody opens the door to something like that, that type of crossover, anything can happen.”

The idea for “Samsara” — a title that aptly signifies a cycle of birth, death and rebirth — arose earlier this year, following a renewed email correspondence between Zorn and Harris. Zorn initially asked about reviving the trio in its original instrumentation, after learning that Harris had started dipping a toe back into drumming. Harris declined, saying he wasn’t yet ready to record on the kit. But after watching an intense 2018 live clip of Harris’s solo-electronics project Fret and consulting with Laswell, Zorn quickly amended his offer.

“When he plays the drums, it’s very much his character,” Zorn said of Harris. “The way he sounds is how he is — very intense. And to do that with electronics as well, it’s like, wow, this is Mick. This is his stuff.”

Zorn improvised over Harris’s tracks without previewing them, to get closer to a live-in-the-room feel. Laswell did something similar, taking several spontaneous passes through each piece, adding both rhythmic lines and more textural contributions, which Dellatacoma wove into the tracks. Laswell said that while his finger pain made playing the bass painful, “I did it somehow.” “I used a lot of effects,” he added, specifying that he embraced distortion in light of his limited facility. “It opened up a new direction.”

Yoko Yamabe, Laswell’s partner and manager, said in an interview that throughout Laswell’s period of poor health, turning away from music has never been an option. “He’s all about nothing else,” she said, adding that for Laswell, music is ever-present, like “sky or air.”

Zorn, who has also made two searching duo albums with Laswell in the last several years, said that their recent collaborations were in part a gesture of care for his longtime friend. “I love the guy, and it’s hard to see anyone go through that,” he said, adding, “I want to get his blood pumping; I want him to feel involved.”

Laswell sounded confident that PainKiller’s latest direction — set to continue in 2025 with another new album by the trio — was true to the project’s initial spirit.

“It’s still the same choir, same voice and same statement,” he said, “and most important with that idea is the same power.”

How Do You Spell Rock Royalty? R.E.M.
In a new biography, Peter Ames Carlin chronicles the rise of an indispensable band and the evolution of its music.

It takes a village to raise a rock band. That’s part of the premise of Peter Ames Carlin’s sensitive and well-made new biography, “The Name of This Band Is R.E.M.” The village was Athens, Ga., in the late 1970s and early ’80s, where an art and music scene thrived in the shadow of University of Georgia football.

Michael Stipe (singer) met Peter Buck (guitarist) in a record store. They bonded in part over their love of Patti Smith’s raw LP “Horses.” They began to collaborate in an old church, remade into apartments, where Buck lived. A UGA student named Kathleen O’Brien lived there, too.

O’Brien was a connector. She introduced Stipe and Buck to Bill Berry (drums) and Mike Mills (bass). Three of these guys were UGA students, too. Buck had dropped out of Emory. Next, she coaxed the four of them into playing their first public gig in the church’s sanctuary. The occasion was her birthday, April 5, 1980. She worked her large network of friends to ensure turnout. She procured the beer and talked some musicians out of their stage fright.

The band, by all accounts, was magic from the start. Others began to pitch in on its behalf. Some volunteered to lug amps or procure gigs or loan them money when they were desperate or work the phones calling DJs, urging them to play the band’s songs. The band was the train, but others laid track. That Carlin pays such close attention to how many people had a hand in the band’s early success gives his book a spirited communal vibe.

Athens wasn’t Nowheresville, musically speaking. The city was already home to the party-out-of-bounds art band the B-52s and to Pylon, post-punk regional heroes. Finding a name wasn’t easy. Early options included (oh no!) Third Wives, Slut Bank and Negro Wives. Stipe found “r.e.m.,” an abbreviation of rapid eye movement, while leafing through a dictionary.

R.E.M. was the college radio darling of the early ’80s before breaking into the mainstream. Its first six albums overlapped almost exactly with my college years. (I took a long time to graduate.) It is hard to overstate their impact. Here was a new generation, knocking at the door, making music that made you aware of the hairs on the back of your neck. Here was a band to have in your corner if you were gearing down for a difficult winter.

The lyrics were inscrutable; so were their early videos. R.E.M. was determined not to be understood in a hurry. This defiantly outsider posturing left the band open to accusations of selling out when it hired John Mellencamp’s producer to work on its fourth studio album, “Lifes Rich Pageant” (1986), and later signed with a major label.

Carlin, who has previously written biographies of Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen, is agnostic on the sellout question. He explores how R.E.M.’s sound gained clarity and opened up on its midcareer albums, leading to a series of singles that sounded better than anything else on FM radio: “The One I Love,” “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine),” “Losing My Religion,” “Man on the Moon,” “Everybody Hurts,” “Nightswimming.”

He recognizes the pain of critics like Sue Cummings, who savaged “Lifes Rich Pageant” in Spin, lamenting the loss of the band’s “soft-focus, Pre-Raphaelite, dance-barefoot-in-the-kudzu utopian vision.” Either way, Rolling Stone declared on a 1987 cover that R.E.M. was the best rock band in America.

One reason that band stayed together as long as it did, and that its members remained friends, is that they decided early on to share all songwriting credits. Stipe wrote many but not all the lyrics. “(Don’t Go Back to) Rockville,” for example, was written entirely by Mills.

Carlin is canny about the band’s enveloping sound — the grain and grandeur of Stipe’s voice, the folk-rock chiming of Buck’s Rickenbacker, Mills’s yelping background vocals and the way Mills and Berry locked in hard together on bass and drums. “It was in that space, in the blur between obscurity and tenderness, that the heart of the band resided,” Carlin writes.

We don’t get close, personally, to any of the band’s members. None granted Carlin an interview. Drugs and drinking are mentioned only sparingly. Ditto sex, though the androgynous Stipe slept with men and women and had a relationship with Natalie Merchant. “I don’t think it’s anyone’s business,” Stipe once said of his romantic life, “unless you’re sitting in my lap.” There is a certain amount of clashing of rock star egos.

Carlin notes how adept R.E.M. was, from the start, at keeping the press at bay. Even in separate interviews they all seemed to be reading from the same talking points. It’s good business practice that makes for sometimes dull reading.

Is it true, as the former Hüsker Dü guitarist Bob Mould wrote in his memoir, “See a Little Light” (2011), that Stipe used to force some guests to enter his house, humiliatingly, through a window? Carlin doesn’t mention Mould. Who can forget the years when Stipe ostentatiously embraced nearly every progressive cause known to mankind, becoming in the process a walking NPR tote bag?

Long international tours took a toll. In 1995, Berry suffered a brain aneurysm onstage in Europe and nearly died. He retired from the band two years later. R.E.M. played its last show in 2008.

America is so large that many of our best songs are about missing people or wanting to go home. R.E.M.’s flame hasn’t dimmed in Athens, and nearly all the band’s members still have ties there.

I’ve been playing the early albums for nearly a week, the time it’s taken me to read Carlin’s book, make notes, watch the election news and write this review. R.E.M.’s music does for me what it always has — it adds a shivery sense of the mythic to the ordinary and everyday. And it still sounds good loud.

Shaboozey Has Something New to Toast: 6 Grammy Nominations
The country singer’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” has been omnipresent; now it’s up for song of the year in February.

It was one of the songs of the summer that persisted into the fall: ubiquitous in restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops and, appropriately, bars.

Now, Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the foot-stomping smash that held No. 1 for 16 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, will compete for one of the Grammys’ biggest awards: song of the year.

But well before Friday’s nominations, the record helped change Shaboozey’s career. The genre-bending country singer and rapper born Collins Obinna Chibueze caught the attention of a member of Beyoncé’s team when he performed the song at a label showcase before it had been released.

Not long after, he was tapped for features on Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter.” Then came the well-timed release of his third album, “Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going.”

When his six Grammy nods rolled in — the first of his career — Shaboozey, 29, was on a tour bus in Kentucky as part of his arena tour with Jelly Roll, where each night he says he gets a rush when audiences sing, clap and stomp along to “A Bar Song.”

“It’s the same feeling I get every single night I perform that song, from the first time I played it til now,” he said in an interview on Friday following his nominations, which include nods for best new artist and for his feature on “Spaghettii,” from Beyoncé’s LP.

Ahead of a show in Lexington, Shaboozey discussed how rediscovering a 20-year-old rap song sparked his hit, and what he thinks gives the track its staying power. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Every artist has a different take on the Grammys — some revere the awards, some shun them altogether. What has your relationship been?

I don’t think I had ever been nominated for an award ever, even as a kid. It’s the Grammys — I’ve never even been invited. It’s a huge deal and a huge honor to me. Personally, I’m super optimistic, but because there’s so much talent on that list it’s going to be a hard one.

What was it like when you first performed “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” at that pivotal showcase?

We had just made “A Bar Song,” like, a couple of days before. That was my first time performing it. We did our soundcheck and when we did that song, the six people that were there stood up and clapped, and so we knew then and there that it was going to be a big moment. To be able to tease a song in a live show and people immediately learn the lyrics by the time you get to the second chorus — it was crazy.

Why do you think the song has had such staying power?

A lot of songs are about breakups or heartbreak or loss, and I think in the midst of all that music it’s rare to have something that feels that bright. By the last chorus, with the fiddle — I always compare it to the scene in “The Hobbit” in the shire where everyone’s on the table and they’re all holding their mugs. I just equate it to that or even the “Titanic” scene where they’re partying in the mess area. You feel it when you hear the song.

Do you have a specific bar that you think of?

I have an idea of it — it’s like the best parts of a dive bar. I think of people from different walks of life and a whole bunch of people you wouldn’t see together. It’s dimly lit with old bar signs and you can’t get a drink, but everyone’s got one.

The song interpolates a record from 2004 by Jerrell Jones, known as J-Kwon, who is also nominated now for the song. It feels like you both changed each other’s career in a way.

His song peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100 and it’s crazy because it’s such a big song, a big part of my childhood. To be able to get this opportunity to come together and get that No. 1 for him and myself — it’s just remarkable. Sometimes artists are not eager to clear a sample, like, “Who’s this guy? What’s he going to do with my song?” He was always just open and supportive of this random person who happened to interpolate one of his songs. He deserves this just as much as anybody, just as much as I do.

You released your first single in 2014 as a rapper. At this stage of your career, after your segue into country music, how does it feel to receive a nomination for best new artist?

It’s a dream come true. I’ve had so many different eras of music. The music I’ve found myself making on this project and the last one, this is truly an authentic version of me and this is the music that I want to be making, hopefully, for the rest of my life. To finally feel like I’ve found my sound and found my place and my confidence — it just shows I’m going in the right direction.

Did Beyoncé’s Grammy Nods Really Top Michael Jackson’s for ‘Thriller’?
Not exactly. But in Grammyland, nothing is simple.

On Friday, as the news emerged of Beyoncé’s 11 Grammy nominations for her country-Beyoncé-style album “Cowboy Carter,” some fan accounts on social media trumpeted that it had become “the most Grammy-nominated album of all time,” and claimed that Beyoncé had even topped a record set in 1984 by Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” the mega-blockbuster against which all other hits have since been judged.

Was that true? Not quite. But in some ways her accomplishment was equivalent to Jackson’s.

In the sometimes confusing world of Grammy stats, nominations for an artist can be spread across multiple projects, and the performing artist on a song or an album is not necessarily an award’s nominee — prizes can (and often do) go to collaborators like songwriters, producers or engineers.

And Beyoncé is not the only recent artist to receive 11 nominations in one year. Kendrick Lamar did so for the 2016 awards, as did Jon Batiste for 2022 — but in both cases, they were not all for work on a single album. (Lamar’s nods that year, for example, included his guest appearance on Taylor Swift’s song “Bad Blood.”)

Officially, “Thriller” received a total of 13 nods when the 26th annual Grammy nominations were announced in early 1984. Jackson himself was cited in 11 of them. Of the two others, one was for Bruce Swedien, the album’s renowned engineer. The other cited Quincy Jones and James Ingram, the writers of the song “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),” which was up for best rhythm & blues song. In a sign of Jackson’s thorough dominance that year, two other “Thriller” songs were nominated in that same category: “Billie Jean” and “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’.” (“Billie Jean,” credited to Jackson as the sole songwriter, won.)

Ultimately, Jackson collected seven awards for “Thriller,” including album of the year and record of the year (for “Beat It”). Swedien won best engineered recording, non-classical. That night was one of Jackson’s most iconic moments. He attended the show with Brooke Shields and Emmanuel Lewis as guests, and wore a sparkling blue-and-gold military-style jacket, with a crystal glove over his right hand.

But that was not all. Jackson narrated a soundtrack album for the film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” with music by John Williams — which became a legal nightmare because MCA Records, which released the “E.T.” album, had not gotten the necessary clearance from Jackson’s label, Epic, for him to appear on it.

Epic refused to provide that clearance until a deal — meaning a big payment — could be sorted. “It went on for months, corporate lawyers yammering back and forth as only they can,” Jones wrote in his memoir, “Q.” According to Jones, Epic received a $500,000 advance for its permission, and neither he nor Jackson received a penny of it. At the Grammys in 1984, Jackson’s “E.T.” album won best recording for children — his eighth trophy of the night.

So Jackson had more nominations total in 1984, though Beyoncé has now tied him for the number of nods for a single album.

In Grammyland, however, there are often asterisks. The 12 nominations that Jackson received in 1984 were the most in a single year for any artist to that point. But in 1997 his record was tied by Babyface, the R&B producer and songwriter. How did that measure up?

Babyface, who has had a golden touch for years — he’s won producer of the year at the Grammys four times, more than any other person — received his nominations that year for projects involving multiple artists, including Whitney Houston, Toni Braxton, Brandy and Eric Clapton; in some categories, Babyface worked on multiple titles, which limited the number of awards he could have won. He ended the night with three wins.
