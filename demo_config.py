Israeli Strike in the Heart of Beirut Kills at Least 20
Israel was targeting a senior Hezbollah commander, but failed to kill him, one Israeli official said. Hezbollah officials said none of the group’s leaders were at the attack site.

An Israeli airstrike on a residential building in central Beirut killed at least 20 people on Saturday, the Lebanese Health Ministry said, part of an intensifying Israeli military campaign that appears aimed at pressuring Hezbollah into a cease-fire deal.

The strike was an attempt to assassinate a top Hezbollah military commander, Mohammad Haidar, according to three Israeli defense officials who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations. Hezbollah officials on Saturday afternoon said that none of the group’s leaders were at the site of the airstrike, and later in the day, one of the Israeli officials said Mr. Haidar was not killed.

Over the past week, Israeli ground troops made a concerted push deeper into southern Lebanon while Israel intensified its bombardment of the Dahiya, a cluster of neighborhoods on the southern outskirts of Beirut that are effectively governed by Hezbollah.

The death toll in the latest strike was expected to rise, and at least 66 people were injured, according to the Health Ministry. The strike came just after 4 a.m., jolting Beirut residents awake with thundering explosions that left much of the city enveloped in acrid smoke. It was the third strike this week in central Beirut, an area that had largely been spared since the war between Hezbollah and Israel escalated.

Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, said the airstrike hit a multistory building that was believed to house at least 35 people in the Basta neighborhood of Beirut, an area that is home to both Sunni and Shiite Muslims and close to several Western embassies. Hezbollah is a Shiite militant group and Shiite communities in southern and eastern Lebanon have borne the brunt of Israeli attacks over the past few months.

The war in Lebanon has killed more than 3,500 people and forced almost a quarter of the population to flee their homes. Some Shiites who fled the Dahiya have taken refuge in Basta, according to residents of the area.

“There was no prior warning,” Mr. Abiad said of the Basta strike in a phone interview. “It appears there are still bodies under the rubble.”

A crowd of onlookers and rescue workers gathered outside the blast site. Among them were Iman Ismael, a refugee from Syria, and her 10-year-old son, who were waiting for news about four relatives who had lived in the destroyed building.

“They are still missing,” she said. “God, please let them survive.”

The building was just three doors down from another building that Israel bombed last month in an attempt to kill another senior Hezbollah official. Zainab Rummu, 54, said the strike in October had felt like “the end of the world” and forced residents to repair their damaged homes and neighborhood. Now they would have to do it again.

“We thought it was over. No more danger,” she said. “Now where can I go?”

Later on Saturday morning, Israel issued new evacuation warnings for the Dahiya.

The new wave of attacks on Lebanon came as Israel and Hezbollah appeared to be inching toward a cease-fire deal.

An Israeli official said Friday that there was “cautious optimism” about prospects for a truce in negotiations mediated by the United States, though Lebanese officials were less sanguine about a deal. Both Israel and Hezbollah have said they will keep fighting as negotiations go on.

Heavy fighting was reported overnight in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam which the Israeli military has been attempting to encircle in recent days, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency. Hezbollah said on Friday that it had repeatedly attacked Israeli forces in and around the large town, which lies around three miles from the Israeli border.

Israel began an intensified military campaign against Hezbollah in September in response to almost a year of near-daily rocket attacks on northern Israel. Hezbollah said the attacks were in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. Both armed groups are back by Iran.

Israel said it was going to war in Lebanon to stop the rockets and to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern towns that were evacuated last year. But the rocket attacks have not ceased, and those residents have been unable to return home.

The war has become the bloodiest conflict inside Lebanon since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.

Trump’s Trade Agenda Could Benefit Friends and Punish Rivals
Donald Trump has a record of pardoning favored companies from tariffs. Companies are once again lining up to try to influence him.

The sweeping tariffs that President-elect Donald J. Trump imposed in his first term on foreign metals, machinery, clothing and other products were intended to have maximum impact around the world. They sought to shutter foreign factories, rework international supply chains and force companies to make big investments in the United States.

But for many businesses, the most important consequences of the tariffs, enacted in 2018 and 2019, unfolded just a few blocks from the White House.

In the face of pushback from companies reliant on foreign products, the Trump administration set up a process that allowed them to apply for special exemptions. The stakes were high: An exemption could relieve a company of tariffs as high as 25 percent, potentially giving it a big advantage over competitors.

That ignited a swift and often successful lobbying effort, especially from Washington’s high-priced K Street law firms, which ended up applying for hundreds of thousands of tariff exemptions. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, which handled exclusions for the China tariffs, fielded more than 50,000 requests, while the Commerce Department received nearly 500,000 exclusion requests for the tariffs on steel and aluminum.

As Mr. Trump dangles new and potentially more expensive tariffs, many companies are already angling to obtain relief. Lawyers and lobbyists in Washington say they are receiving an influx of requests from companies that want to hire their services, even before the full extent of the president-elect’s tariff plans becomes clear.

In his first term, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of as much as 25 percent on more than $300 billion in Chinese goods, and 10 percent to 25 percent on steel and aluminum from a variety of countries, including Canada, Mexico and Japan.

This time, Mr. Trump has threatened to impose a 60 percent tariff or more on China, and tariffs of 10 percent to 20 percent on most other countries. He has also suggested targeting particular companies or industries.

It remains unclear which of these plans he intends to follow through on, and he has not clarified whether he would once again offer companies exclusions from the tariffs. On Friday, Mr. Trump announced that he had picked Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, as his Treasury secretary. Mr. Bessent has described Mr. Trump’s tariffs as a negotiating strategy to secure better free trade deals, suggesting he may favor a less aggressive tariff policy.

While Mr. Trump has often promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, some have argued that these trade rules did the opposite. Tracking by OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization, showed that the number of clients lobbying Congress on trade issues ticked up noticeably once Mr. Trump took office, growing more than 50 percent from 2016 to hit a record high in 2019.

One recent economic study also found evidence that Trump officials had used the exemption process to reward their supporters and punish opponents.

The study, which looked at nearly 7,000 company applications, found that an increase in past contributions to Republicans raised the likelihood of a company’s receiving an exemption. A history of past contributions to Democrats, meanwhile, decreased a company’s chances of winning a lucrative exemption.

Jesus Salas, a professor at Lehigh University and one of the study’s authors, called the exclusions process “a very effective spoils system.”

“I would not be surprised at all if this happened again,” he said.

Simon Johnson, the British American economist who won a Nobel Prize last month, said higher tariffs could lead companies to stress “a lot more gamesmanship and a lot more effort going into playing the system and getting special breaks,” rather than “focusing on becoming more productive and creating more jobs.”

Some trade experts say Mr. Trump and his advisers could choose not to offer exclusions, arguing that companies have had enough time to move factories out of China. The Biden administration has maintained Mr. Trump’s tariffs, but it has gradually wound down the exclusions processes for China tariffs, while continuing to grant them for tariffs on steel and aluminum.

On the other hand, trade experts say, if there are no exclusions for Mr. Trump’s future tariffs, the levies could harm American factories that may not be able to buy certain parts and components outside China. A big tariff on those products could convince manufacturers that it makes more economic sense to set up their factories outside the United States entirely. That would undercut the central goal of Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which is to push companies to make their products in the United States.

In Mr. Trump’s first term, officials argued that their exclusions system would offer companies relief in cases where the tariff would harm American interests, or where substitute products weren’t available outside China.

But for many critics, the administration’s decisions on exclusions often seemed mysterious and arbitrary. Tariff exemptions were given to Bibles but not to textbooks, to salmon but not to pollock, to children’s car seats but not to baby cribs. The decisions were not subject to appeal.

Many small businesses complained that they did not have the resources or understanding of Washington to file any exclusions, while some firms filed more than 1,000 requests alone.

Law firms staffed by former Trump administration officials swelled their lists of clients. One congressman’s office sent a letter to Trump officials questioning why the lawmaker should provide support for the administration’s choice legislation while certain exclusions for companies in his district had not yet been approved, an investigation by ProPublica found.

Chief executives also exerted their influence: Tim Cook of Apple repeatedly lobbied President Trump to loosen his administration’s restrictions on trade with China, and secured exemptions for the iPhone and other Apple products.

Other companies were allowed to file objections to any firm’s application, and some were dismayed to see their competitors weigh in against their requests.

Nicole Bivens Collinson, a trade lawyer at Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said she had seen examples in which companies colluded with business partners to file objections to tariff relief requests by competitors. “That goes on, but it’s difficult to prove,” she said.

Part of the problem for the government was the huge volume of requests. While previous administrations had offered exclusions processes over the years, no process existed at the time, so Trump officials had to quickly create one.

Understaffed government agencies were swiftly overwhelmed by tens of thousands of requests. The most prolific single requester, Alloy Tool Steel, put in nearly 40,000 requests for exclusions.

Subsequent investigations found unfairness in the process. In 2019, the Commerce Department’s inspector general found that there had been “the appearance of improper influence in decision-making.” At the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a government investigation found “inconsistencies” in decisions and a lack of transparency.

A similarly uneven process played out for farmers who had been hurt by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. In 2019, his administration began approving tens of billions of dollars to offset farmers’ losses from his trade wars, which had prompted retaliation from China and other countries.

A government watchdog found that the payments favored farms in the South over those in other areas, gave higher payments to farmers of cotton than to farmers of other crops and funneled more money to big farms than to small ones. Another study showed that many payments went to wheat farmers, despite their relatively low shipments to China.

Some lawyers and companies say that exceptions are still badly needed, and that the system has become more systematic and orderly over time.

“It is, in my view, becoming the way you do business,” Ludmilla Kasulke, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, said. She said companies were preparing themselves to make the best of whatever tariffs and exclusions might be available.

“Businesses and stakeholders are going to be thinking about — should be thinking about — where those various pivot points are going to be, where they have an opportunity to make their case,” she said.

What Elon Musk Needs From China
From electric cars to solar panels, Mr. Musk has built businesses in high-tech manufacturing sectors now targeted by Beijing for Chinese dominance.

No American business leader has more visibly and lavishly supported President-elect Donald J. Trump than Elon Musk — and few if any have a more complex relationship with China, a country that Mr. Trump has vowed to confront with higher tariffs and other measures.

Mr. Musk has a lot on the line. His best-known company, the electric vehicle maker Tesla, makes half its cars in China. Tesla sells more cars in China than anywhere except the United States, and his local competition is getting stronger. Chinese regulators have not yet allowed Tesla to offer its latest assisted-driving and self-driving car technology, while allowing Chinese automakers to race ahead with similar systems.

Mr. Musk has personally appealed to China’s premier, Li Qiang, for permission to proceed with what Tesla calls Full Self-Driving as the company’s market share in China has dwindled. Some experts have suggested that Beijing may be able to turn Mr. Musk into an influential ally in trying to persuade Mr. Trump to take a more conciliatory approach on trade.

“When Chinese leaders have an important message to convey to President Trump, Elon Musk would clearly be the best conduit,” said Michael Dunne, a longtime China automotive consultant now based in San Diego.

Competition from China is getting tougher.
Many of Mr. Musk’s other companies, including his ventures in solar energy and large batteries, face formidable competition from Chinese businesses. Some of his businesses might benefit from a decoupling of the Chinese and American economies. Steep tariffs, initially imposed by Mr. Trump in his first term and increased by President Biden, have stopped a push by Chinese automakers into the American market.

“Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world,” Mr. Musk said on a Tesla earnings call in January.

Practically all of Mr. Musk’s rivals in Silicon Valley and Seattle have focused on digital technologies, but Mr. Musk has built factories in high-tech manufacturing industries.

Mr. Musk is competing in global industries that the Chinese government finances heavily — not only electric vehicles but also batteries, solar energy and space launches. China’s state-controlled banking system ramped up net lending to industry to $670 billion last year from $83 billion in 2019.

“In just about every area where his companies focus, there are many Chinese competitors,” said Scott Kennedy, a Chinese business and economics specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “He is basically in industries where the Chinese are the opponents as opposed to his partners.”

Mr. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, which tested its giant Starship on Tuesday with Mr. Trump among the guests, faces emerging rivalries with state-linked Chinese companies that also want to offer launches. Tesla Energy produces large battery packs used by electricity grids for energy storage in combination with solar or wind power, in a growing market otherwise dominated by China.

China is now the world’s main supplier of solar panels, but Tesla Energy, in partnership with Qcells of South Korea, still has a foothold in that sector. And at a time when China produces most of the world’s giant tunneling machines for the construction of subways, water systems and military bases, Mr. Musk has established his own Boring Company in southern Texas.

Tesla is still waiting on approval for full self-driving.
Mr. Musk faces tough competition from China in most of his businesses, but the electric car sector is more complicated.

In addition to being a critical consumer market for Tesla, China is home to the company’s biggest single assembly plant, built in less than a year.

That factory, in Shanghai, also supplies much of the European market after the company encountered political obstacles and even arson at its factory in Germany. Tesla has also imported electric car battery packs from China to the United States to supplement its own production in Nevada.

Chinese regulators have not yet allowed Tesla to introduce Full Self-Driving on Chinese roads. But numerous Chinese companies, including Nio, Huawei and Baidu, have been allowed to introduce similar or more advanced alternatives. Premier Li, who met with Mr. Musk in the spring, helped Tesla rush its factory construction in Shanghai five years ago when he was the city’s Communist Party secretary. Still, Tesla is awaiting approval for its latest self-driving technology.

Tesla is “at a complete disadvantage in the Chinese market because they don’t have an intelligent driving system,” said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a Detroit consulting firm specializing in China’s automotive sector.

When Tesla’s cars became available in large numbers in 2020, their instant popularity transformed the Chinese car market by making electric vehicles seem fashionable and appealing, said Bill Russo, an electric car consultant in Shanghai.

Since then, state-controlled banks have lent billions of dollars at low interest rates to Chinese automakers, which have used the money to wage fierce price wars that have wrecked profit margins. Tesla has participated in the price competition, but its China sales have grown more slowly than those of its local rivals.

Like most American businesses in China, Tesla faces potential political risks, even with Mr. Musk’s close relationship with Mr. Trump.

Citing national security, the Biden administration has begun a regulatory proceeding to prohibit the import or sale in the United States of cars from China or Russia with connections to digital networks. If that proceeding continues in the Trump administration and results in a ban on such cars, Chinese regulators could retaliate by limiting Tesla cars, which rely on extensively photographing their surroundings to provide even basic driving assistance.

China has already banned Tesla cars in some sensitive locations, like military bases.

The biggest question for Mr. Musk’s influence on Sino-American commercial relations lies in how long his alliance with Mr. Trump will last. Mr. Musk contributed more than $100 million to Mr. Trump’s election effort. But some analysts already question whether their friendship can endure long enough to make a difference.

“The largest two egos in the world are eventually going to have a falling-out,” Mr. Le said.

Well, was it worth it, New York Giants fans? “DeVito mania” added some much-needed fun to a disastrous 2023 season, but with the benefit of hindsight, it’s pretty easy to see the consequences of that fun were disastrous, too. There’s no way around it: Tommy DeVito’s three-game winning streak last year cost the team a top-three pick and the chance to add one of the top three quarterbacks selected in the 2024 NFL Draft.

Instead, the Giants had to settle for the sixth pick — after failing to trade up for Drake Maye — while bypassing the opportunity to draft Michael Penix Jr., J.J. McCarthy and Bo Nix. Re-litigating that decision is a story for another time, but as DeVito prepares to take the reins for the Giants again, it’s worth remembering what happened last year when the QB led the Giants to some costly victories.

Will he do it again this year? We’ll find out soon, but if he does, it could prove to be even more costly. This 2025 crop of draft-eligible quarterbacks isn’t believed to be nearly as strong as last year, and it’s possible only one or two emerge as players worthy of being selected in the first round.

For the QB-desperate Giants, that means draft positioning is paramount.

On that front, there’s some good news: They don’t face an easy upcoming slate. Of their seven remaining games, our NFL Projection Model has them favored in just one (against Dallas on Thanksgiving).

It should go without saying no one should expect the Giants to lose on purpose. They’re not going to tank.

“I think we all need to be committed to doing everything we can do to close out the season the right way,” Giants coach Brian Daboll said recently.

Obviously, winning games is what Daboll is supposed to do. It also happens to probably be in his best interest in terms of job security. But the fact remains that losing out and securing the highest possible draft pick is probably the best outcome for the franchise’s future.

Through that lens, the next three games are the most crucial for the Giants. As you can see in the chart above, they look like the most winnable games on paper for New York, though Week 17 against the Colts also is close to even odds.

First up is the Buccaneers (4-6), who are on a four-game losing streak but are getting healthier off of their bye week. Still, it’s a good time for DeVito to debut, with Tampa Bay’s defense putting up some atrocious stats the last four weeks: It is last in the league in EPA/play (-0.20), per TruMedia. But while DeVito looks set up for some success, Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield could be, too. The Giants defense ranks 31st in opposing passer rating at 104.7.

Following the Bucs game, the Giants have a short week and then fly to Dallas for a Thanksgiving Day division matchup with the Cowboys (3-7).  These two teams have already played each other, though that Week 4 game (a 20-15 Cowboys win at MetLife Stadium) feels like eons ago. Neither team looks the same as it did in September. In fact, neither team will even start the same quarterback. This one looks like it will be DeVito vs. Cooper Rush as opposed to Daniel Jones vs. Dak Prescott.

The Cowboys’ season went off the rails two weeks after that win over the Giants. They were smacked by the Detroit Lions 47-9 in Week 6, kick-starting a five-game losing streak. During that stretch, they also lost Prescott to a season-ending hamstring injury and have become a disaster. Suffice it to say, this game could get ugly fast.

Last to come in this vital three-game stretch are the Saints (4-7), who are on a two-game winning streak since firing coach Dennis Allen and promoting Darren Rizzi. New Orleans looks rejuvenated under its interim head coach, but who knows how long that will last?

Current draft positioning
Heading into Week 12, the Giants are slated to pick third, behind the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-9) and the Tennessee Titans (2-8), according to Tankathon. Though the Giants and Titans have the same record, the Titans would receive the better draft pick because of their inferior strength of schedule figure.

As this season comes to a close, that’s going to be a key number to keep an eye on. Strength of schedule is the first tiebreaker the league uses to determine draft position between teams with the same record. The team with the lower strength of schedule, the aggregate winning percentage of a team’s opponents, receives the better pick. Right now, that’s bad news for the Giants. Their strength of schedule (.520) is one of the highest among teams jockeying for the No. 1 pick.

What that means for Giants fans in terms of rooting interest is easy, though: Root against anyone the Giants have played or will play the rest of the year. The more losses those teams pile up, the lower the Giants’ strength of schedule becomes.

As for the teams Giants fans should root for, well, it’s pretty much any team with four wins or fewer. There are a lot of them right now — 14 to be exact. However, the good news for Giants fans hoping to land the top pick is that the team has a decent shot.

Right now, according to our projection model, the Giants have a 12 percent chance of landing the No. 1 pick. That trails only the QB-needy Raiders (35 percent) and puts them ahead of the Browns (11 percent), who may have done the Giants an enormous favor by winning on Thursday night. They entered Thursday with a 28 percent chance of securing the top pick.

Here are the odds for the remaining two- and three-win teams:

• Titans (10 percent)
• Jaguars (10 percent)
• Patriots (8 percent)
• Panthers (7 percent)
• Cowboys (4 percent)
• Jets (3 percent)

As the Giants enter the backstretch of their season, there’s little doubt it’s in their best interest to lose most, if not all, of their remaining games. As a fan, that’s not always easy to root for, but for those needing the motivation, you need only look back to last season at what “DeVito mania” cost the Giants.

Kendrick Lamar Releases a Surprise Album, ‘GNX’
The rapper’s sixth studio album follows the success of a pair of tracks this year that were sparked by a war of words with Drake.

Kendrick Lamar, the rapper laureate and one of the music world’s least predictable stars, released a surprise new album, “GNX,” on Friday.

It is the sixth studio album by Lamar, 37, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018 and, even before releasing the album, has been having a banner year. In the spring, two songs that came out of a rapid-fire diss-track war with Drake — “Like That” and “Not Like Us” — became some of his biggest hits in years. “Not Like Us” went to No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and was nominated for both record and song of the year at the Grammys.

In February, Lamar is also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show.

“GNX,” with 12 tracks, appeared on streaming services midday on Friday, with little accompanying information. The album’s cover art, and a one-minute teaser video that was released at the same time, revolve around an image of a black vintage muscle car. On the cover, Lamar slouches against the rear of the vehicle, and the video — with swelling strings and Lamar’s multi-tracked, rapid-fire vocals — shows Lamar with the car in an empty, monumental space.

Among the songs is one titled “Heart Pt. 6,” the latest in a series of tracks with similar titles, which has become a Lamar signature. It is also an implicit rejoinder against Drake, who had released a diss track in May called “The Heart Part 6.”

“GNX” is Lamar’s first album after he left Top Dawg Entertainment (T.D.E.), the Los Angeles label that discovered him more than a decade ago. The copyright notice for “GNX” on streaming services credited the release to pgLang, the creative agency that Lamar started with his longtime collaborator, Dave Free. (The album was released “under exclusive license” to Interscope Records, a major label under the giant Universal Music Group.)

Lamar’s last album, “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,” was released in 2022 after a five-year wait.

Elon Musk Gets a Crash Course in How Trumpworld Works
The world’s richest person, not known for his humility, is still learning the cutthroat courtier politics of Donald Trump’s inner circle — and his ultimate influence remains an open question.

For the first 53 years of his life, Elon Musk barely spent any time with Donald J. Trump. Then, beginning on the night of Nov. 5, he spent basically no time without him.

And so Mr. Musk, more than any other key player in the presidential transition, finds himself in a cram session to learn the courtier politics of Mr. Trump’s inner circle. For the world’s richest person — not known for his humility or patience — it is a social engineering challenge far trickier and less familiar than heavy manufacturing or rocket science.

Doubts abound as to whether he will graduate in 2028 with a four-year degree in Trumpism: It is now a parlor game in Washington and Silicon Valley to speculate just how long the Musk-Trump relationship will last. The answer, as discarded aides from Mr. Trump’s first term will tell you, may depend on Mr. Musk’s ability to placate the boss and keep a relatively low profile — but also to shiv a rival when the time comes.

In short, how to play the politics of Trumpworld.

Most of the people who now surround Mr. Trump in the transition are battle-tested aides from his past fights, or decades-long personal friends. Mr. Musk is neither. What he brings instead are his 200 million followers on X and the roughly $200 million he spent to help elect Mr. Trump. Both of those have greatly impressed the president-elect. Mr. Trump, gobsmacked by Mr. Musk’s willingness to lay off 80 percent of the staff at X, has said the tech billionaire will help lead a Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.

Over the last week, Mr. Musk has kept up his buddy routine with Mr. Trump, joining him at nearly every meeting at Mar-a-Lago as well as a U.F.C. fight. On Tuesday, he brought the president-elect to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas for a SpaceX launch.

In private meetings at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Musk shows little familiarity with policy or the potential staff members being discussed, but he returns repeatedly to a central point: What is required, he says, is “radical reform” of government and “reformers” who are capable of executing radical changes, according to two people briefed on the meetings, who insisted on anonymity to describe the internal conversations.

On Wednesday, Mr. Musk, who often criticizes the mainstream news media, wrote an essay in The Wall Street Journal with Mr. Ramaswamy that detailed more of their plan for the new agency they call DOGE.

Mr. Musk has not been particularly aggressive about pushing his preferred names for administration roles. But his tech-world orbit is emboldened and widely seen as influential.

Mick Mulvaney, who served as Mr. Trump’s second chief of staff and now works at a lobbying firm, Actum, has told clients that tech executives are likely to have extraordinary access.

“Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, Joe Lonsdale and other tech leaders are influencing Trump’s preparations for his second term, something which no other business leaders have been able to do at this level in past presidential elections,” reads a presentation shared by Mr. Mulvaney with clients, which was seen by The New York Times.

But Mr. Mulvaney, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, has sounded skeptical about Mr. Musk’s ability to deliver on his promised budget cuts.

He recently told clients on a call with about 70 people that Mr. Musk would find out that “going to Mars is easier,” according to a person who was listening and described the call. Mr. Mulvaney, the person added, said that he did not envision a wholesale change of how the federal government did business, and that he doubted Mr. Musk would stick around to actually get it done.

The tech leaders whom Mr. Mulvaney highlighted are indeed firmly in the transition conversation.

Several friends of Mr. Musk’s have been spotted at Mar-a-Lago in recent days, including Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Lonsdale and Ken Howery. Mr. Lonsdale, a founder of Palantir, has told peers that he was being considered for multiple roles, including secretary of education, but that he declined to move forward, wanting to stick to his business career and private philanthropy. Mr. Sacks, another friend of Mr. Musk’s, has also been involved in the Trump transition, joining calls and spending time at Mar-a-Lago in recent days, according to two people briefed on his activities.

Other tech executives have been scrambling to broker introductions to Mr. Musk or his proxies. Across Silicon Valley, interest in serving in the Department of Government Efficiency is high. Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, described that work on social media this week as “a once in a lifetime opportunity to increase economic freedom in the U.S. and cut the size of government back to health.” Mr. Musk has been canvassing friends for their interest in formal administration roles, according to a person briefed on his outreach.

Mr. Musk successfully pushed for Brendan Carr, a Republican, to be picked to lead the Federal Communications Commission — a “great choice,” the billionaire wrote after the announcement — although Mr. Carr had always been seen as the favorite. And Mr. Musk has pushed Mr. Trump to bring back Russell T. Vought, another budget director in Mr. Trump’s first term, according to a person briefed on the matter.

But Mr. Musk’s early record also has its blemishes. He pushed for Emil Michael, a former top Uber executive, to be the next transportation secretary, only for Mr. Michael to lose out to Sean Duffy, a former congressman from Wisconsin. Mr. Duffy was backed by Susie Wiles, who will become Mr. Trump’s chief of staff in January, and Reince Priebus, the president-elect’s onetime chief of staff, according to a person briefed on the process.

Mr. Musk also made a very public push for Mr. Trump to choose Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, as his Treasury secretary. The president-elect ultimately declined, instead picking Mr. Lutnick for commerce secretary. And Mr. Musk was a vociferous defender of former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who on Thursday withdrew as Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general.

Mr. Trump’s aides are divided on Mr. Musk’s role. Some see him as relatively harmless, and he is close with Stephen Miller, a top policy aide. Others have chafed at his near-constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, especially given his lack of personal history with Mr. Trump.

So it is notable that Mr. Musk has appeared concerned about the perception of his influence. On Wednesday, in response to a headline describing him as Mr. Trump’s “closest confidant,” the tech billionaire went out of his way to praise “the large number of loyal, good people at Mar-a-Lago who have worked for him for many years.”

“To be clear, while I have offered my opinion on some cabinet candidates, many selections occur without my knowledge and decisions are 100% that of the President,” he wrote on X.

It appeared to be a recognition of a well-known lesson in Trumpworld: Don’t outshine the boss. At least if you want to stay awhile.

Mr. Mulvaney’s advice for Mr. Musk? Be a straight shooter with Mr. Trump, because “there are plenty of people who will feel the need to agree with him all the time.”

“What makes Musk such a valuable adviser,” Mr. Mulvaney told The Times in an interview, “is that he has enough money — and enough other things to do — that he is uniquely situated to be the bearer of honest news. More than perhaps anybody else on the planet, he doesn’t need the job.”

Enjoy the GST break on those Christmas gifts, kids — you’ll still be paying it back long after Justin Trudeau is gone
Canadians repeatedly tell pollsters that the high cost of living is a top priority, and Justin Trudeau is spending some of their money to show he’s listening, Tonda MacCharles writes.

OTTAWA — Take your pick.

The federal Liberals’ GST two-month “holiday” on so-called essential goods plus a $250 cheque for anyone who earned under $150,000 last year is:

a) an artful political move to steal NDP and Conservative thunder via an appeal to working-class Canadians;

b) a tactical ploy to break a parliamentary logjam, and if it fails, to shrug and say, “It’s not us, it’s them”;

c) a shameless bid to buy votes using taxpayers’ money, whether it passes now or turns into a useful stick with which to poke opponents in an election that could happen at any time;

d) a blatant pocketbook appeal to out-populist the populist Conservatives on “axing taxes”;

e) not a very progressive move for a self-declared progressive government.

The answer, of course, is it is all of the above. 

Canadians repeatedly tell pollsters that the high cost of living is a top priority, so it is a tactic to directly appeal to voters.

It borrows heavily from the Liberals’ rivals. The Conservatives campaigned on a December sales tax break like this in 2021. (The Liberals opposed it then.) The NDP pitched a similar cut last week. 

One thing is for sure, the 2024 Liberal version carries a hefty price tag of $6.28 billion — according to early calculations — at a time when Canada’s annual deficit, which Justin Trudeau’s government promised would clock in at around $40 billion, is certain to spike.

Before this announcement, the Parliamentary Budget Officer pegged the federal budget deficit for 2023-24 at $46.8 billion. That’s equal to 1.6 per cent of Canada’s economic output. Ottawa hasn’t yet released the actual number.

The PBO says it will analyze the latest promise, and won’t comment until it does, but it doesn’t have all the information from the Finance Department yet. Nobody does.

But for sure, the kiddies who get cheaper diapers or Christmas toys for the next two months will be the ones paying the tab plus interest, for years to come.

It breaks down this way: That GST tax cut on wine, beer, Christmas trees, toys, clothes, takeout and other miscellaneous items? It adds up to at least $1.6 billion in lost revenue for federal coffers. 

It could cost a little more if Ottawa has to ante up money to appease the five provinces who may gripe about a lost share of revenue where provincial sales taxes are “harmonized” and come on top of a briefly suspended federal sales tax. Trudeau shrugged off that question Friday, saying provinces should realize “this is a way they can be there for people.”

Ontario says it’s already made a similar cut on certain essentials, but New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island complained they were blindsided. Newfoundland’s government said it will go along with the federal plan for a sales tax pause.

And those Doug Ford-style, “chicken in every pot” cheques? They’ll cost the federal treasury $4.68 billion.

More than $6 billion in all — money that could have been better targeted to more needy Canadians, in the view of some like David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

“There’s almost no progressivity to it whatsoever,” said Macdonald in an interview.

The $250 payment is “almost universal,” he said, because only five per cent of Canadian workers earn over $150,000, and the other 95 per cent make $150,000 or less.

“So basically everybody is getting it.”

Instead of sending $250 to “basically everybody,” Macdonald said the government could have sent $500 or $1,000 to the lowest-earning 30 per cent of workers, or the lower half of workers, and concentrated the help to those most in need of a boost right now.

“Presumably it’s the visibility is what’s important here, more so than necessarily substantially helping folks that are maybe turning to food banks because they can’t afford food.”

Macdonald flagged a risk that consumers may not get the full value of five per cent savings that Ottawa is promising via the sales tax break if, for example, grocery stores decide to take up some of that pricing space and it leads to only a two per cent savings for their customers.

That should eventually show up in Statistics Canada’s data on the consumer price index. 

“If we continue to see prices increase, what that means is it wasn’t consumers that got the full value, that it was the stores themselves that took some of this profit,” he said.

But, added Macdonald, “in the long run, it doesn’t change the picture on food prices.”

“It doesn’t decrease prices by 20 per cent which is roughly the amount that they’ve gone up since 2019. It means that people that were turning to food banks in November are going to turn to food banks in March” when the tax holiday ends.

It also doesn’t change the broader picture on housing costs — the other thing Canadians are “absolutely” upset about, said Macdonald. 

He said that is another argument for a more targeted effort to send $1,000 to low-income renters who are struggling with steep monthly payments and are the ones having to turn to those food banks.

Politically, what’s really going on here? A lot.

Of course, the New Democrats claimed credit. 

And of course, the Conservatives — under a new leader since 2022 — panned it.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says the Trudeau government should have followed his advice and presented a permanent sales tax cut, not a temporary one. 

The NDP got out ahead of the Liberals with its own announcement last week that pledged to permanently remove federal GST on a broader range of essentials — home heating and monthly internet and cellphone bills, for example — estimating it would be about $5 billion a year, and proposing to pay for it with a tax on excess corporate profits. Still, he said it was the Liberals who “caved” and the NDP will support the measure.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre would not say he’d vote against it. He is, after all, the “axe the taxes” poster boy.

But he said Conservatives would instead permanently cut “carbon taxes” and the GST on new home construction. 

Poilievre said the Liberal move is inflationary, and hypocritical of Trudeau, whose past words Poilievre quoted when saying the more dollars the government injects into the economy, the more upward pressure it puts on prices.

Trudeau, in announcing the pre-holiday goodies, replied — in effect — that was then, this is now. 

Inflation, he argued, is easing, and this temporary measure will bring broad-based relief without fuelling price hikes.

Jennifer Robson, a professor at Carleton University’s school of public policy and administration, called the twin announcements “gimmicky.”

“The GST holiday is going to be administered by having businesses adjust all of their tax calculations at the register and that’s not cost-free,” she said, adding registers will have to be reset once the holiday is over. 

(The Canadian Federation of Independent Business agrees. It would rather broad-based permanent tax “relief” to increase consumer demand that it says has dampened sales for small business in Canada.)

Robson said the cheques may be a populist measure like Premier Doug Ford’s promise of $200 cheques to Ontarians despite his own budget’s red ink, and a GST cut may persuade some people to shift the timing of some purchases — maybe parents will buy a child car seat earlier. But, she said, it doesn’t ease the squeeze for many.

“I can’t quite explain it except for maybe panic because $250 one time, once, sprinkled across the board in this way, is really not going to fundamentally change the purchasing power of an awful lot of households.”

As for deficit concerns? Pfft, says the government.

Trudeau and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland say the federal government can afford these two measures “because Canada has one of the strongest balance sheets in the world.”

That essentially means that, while the federal budget is still awash in red ink, comparatively speaking there are a lot of other countries worse off than Canada. 

University of Calgary Prof. Trevor Tombe posted on “X” that these “are very costly measures. They do nothing to address the mounting economic challenges that Canada faces.

“By doing this, the government invites valid critiques that it is not taking these pressing issues seriously,” he wrote.

Trudeau dismissed his critics Friday.

He said with the latest moves, he is addressing the needs of more individual “hard-working middle-class Canadians” who didn’t benefit from previous breaks for retirees, disabled people or families with children. 

He called it a “thank you” of sorts for all they did to bring Canada out of the pandemic.

“We’re focused on Canadians. I’ll let the bankers worry about the economy,” he said.

What that also means is that the Liberals and their erstwhile progressive government allies, the New Democrats, just got less progressive. 

They are shifting away from saying government’s role is to help the poorest to saying they should help as many as possible in an election year. 

Where they once defended higher taxes on wealthier Canadians as an investment in health care, child care, long-term care, pharmacare, or dental care, they are now pivoting to using tax dollars as a way to take care of their own electoral prospects, too.

Short-term gain for long-term pain.

A Very Veggie Thanksgiving
Gorgeous mains, vibrant sides and — most important — stuffing.

Across the internet (Instagram), people far and wide (dear friends, distant relatives and women I met once at parties in college) are soft-launching their Thanksgiving menus. With the Friendsgiving season in full swing, stuffings and green bean casseroles and all manner of potatoes clutter my feed, just as they’ll clutter the holiday table a week from today.

Do you know what you’re making? Perhaps you’d like to create a lively Sidesgiving spread. Or maybe you’d prefer to anchor your meal with a showstopping vegetarian main. (Alexa Weibel’s mushroom Wellington, anybody? How about a moment for Khushbu Shah’s new saag paneer lasagna?) The time to decide is now.

In my mind, body and soul, the true Thanksgiving centerpiece is actually stuffing. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re a minimalist (hello, Eric Kim’s buttery sage Thanksgiving stuffing) or a maximalist (Kay Chun’s French onion stuffing beckons).

You can even modify stuffings you thought might not be for you. There’s bacon in the recipe title for Melissa Clark’s five-star stuffing with mushrooms and leeks — but wait! As she notes in the recipe description: “The mushrooms allow vegetarians to nix the bacon without sacrificing all the flavor.” Bingo.

Contrary to some beliefs, this holiday needn’t be a beige onslaught. Surround your stuffing with a rainbow of sides. Red cranberries, orange sweet potatoes, yellow corn, green brussels sprouts — you see the vision.

A red-wine cranberry sauce with honey or lemony cranberry relish can get you started, or you can incorporate cranberries in your spread elsewhere, as Sohla El-Waylly does with her crushed green bean salad or as Christian Reynoso does with his red cabbage salad with orange vinaigrette.

Andy Baraghani’s caramelized squash with cinnamon toasted nuts is a vibrant November sunset, as are Vivian Chan-Tam’s roasted beets with hazelnuts and honey, which feature both golden and red root vegetables. Sohla’s Cheddar-smothered sweet potatoes and Melissa’s maple roasted squash with charred lemon? Sunrises.

Onto greens, then. Hetty Lui McKinnon’s tamarind-maple brussels sprouts and Kay’s miso gravy-smothered green beans get the job done. And might I be so bold as to say your Thanksgiving table needs a salad? Your Thanksgiving table needs a salad.

Melissa’s fennel-apple salad with walnuts provides plenty of crunch, acid and verve, as does Sheela Prakash’s brussels sprouts salad with pomegranate and pistachios. Tabbouleh-esque, her recipe fuses the Levantine salad with more autumnal ingredients, but maintains the traditional bulgur to keep it hearty and vegan.

Or cover the color wheel with a single dish. Let Melissa’s giant roasted vegetable platter be your singular kaleidoscope lighthouse in a sea of taupes and browns, and have the happiest Thanksgiving.

Explore Your Roots: How to Plan a Family Heritage Trip
Online tools are helping Americans travel abroad to discover their ancestry, seek out relatives and obtain documentation for dual citizenship. Here are tips for your journey.

In the second season of the TV show “The White Lotus,” three generations of a fictional American family travel to Sicily to try to reconnect with their ancestral roots. Though their journey goes hilariously wrong at times, heritage trips like theirs have become serious business.

Decades ago, Americans who were interested in traveling to explore their roots had to rely on family lore, sort through dusty books and, often, follow their gut. But DNA-testing sites, online genealogical databases and social media have made searching far easier, fueling a growing interest in heritage travel.

Global heritage tourism is a nearly $600-billion-a-year industry, which is expected to keep growing by about 4 percent annually through 2030, according to market analysis by Grand View Research. And TV programs like “Who Do You Think You Are?” and “Finding Your Roots,” which follow mostly celebrities as they discover their heritage, are continuing to inspire other journeys.

Not everyone goes on a heritage trip for the same reason: Maybe you want to meet living relatives to swap photos and stories. Maybe you are tracking down official documents to obtain dual citizenship. Or you could simply be looking to connect with a place your family once called home.

Here are some tips for planning your own heritage trip.

Follow your DNA
Services like Ancestry.com, FamilyTreeDNA, MyHeritage and the struggling 23andMe use your genes to decode your family’s likely places of origin. Other DNA-testing websites cater to specific ethnic groups, like African Ancestry or Somos Ancestria, for Latino origins. The cost of the DNA test kits, which usually require a saliva sample, can vary from about $40 to $300, depending on the company and how detailed you want your results to be.

Do some free online sleuthing
Birth, death, marriage and census records can help you narrow your search to specific places. You can dig into these sources through the U.S. Census Bureau or the National Archives and Records Administration. If you don’t know where to start, FamilySearch is an easy-to-use, free website funded by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (You don’t have to be a member of the church to use it.)

Find a Grave and BillionGraves are vast databases documenting gravestone locations, which can help you locate family burial plots. If your ancestors served in the military, organizations like Daughters of the American Revolution or the U.S. World War One Centennial Commission can help guide your research.

If you already know your family’s country of origin, check online for ancestry-linked groups in those places that may be able to help you connect to more specific resources. For example, you can try the National Archives of Australia, the Association of Family History Societies of Wales, a database of Korean clans from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, or the Jamaican government’s genealogical research tool. Or home in on your religious heritage with sites like IslamicFamilyTree or JewishGen.

Get social
Start with your extended family: Ask about family trees and previous heritage trips. Then hit social media. Join the conversation in Facebook groups dedicated to specific ethnic groups or locations, like the groups South American Genealogy Research Community; Marshall County, Mississippi, Genealogy; or the Finnish American Heritage Society of Maine. You might even discover a group dedicated to your last name: I found one for “Sims.”

Getting to Know ‘Black London’
Consider hiring a pro
If you don’t have the time or patience to do the legwork, you can hire an expert: The Association of Professional Genealogists maintains a searchable database. Or, you can contract a professional heritage travel planner to help create an itinerary and, in some cases, escort you through your tour.

How much you pay for professional help depends on how much personal guidance you would like. For example, italyMondo!, an agency that customizes Italian heritage tours, will do the genealogical research to create an itinerary for you to follow on your own for $2,000. But for $5,000 to $10,000, you’ll get a professional to accompany you along the way.

Other businesses, like MyChinaRoots, use your research to pinpoint key destinations for a heritage trip. You can choose to hire a heritage-trained guide to help you make the most of your visit: The daily rate for MyChinaRoots guides begins at around $500.

Record your journey
Upload any copies of historic photos or documents on your device, and have some current photos of your own family ready. Also, digitize film, audio or video recordings you’d like to share, using services like EverPresent, iMemories or Legacybox. These might serve as valuable icebreakers if you meet a distant relative.

You can upload photos, along with explanatory notes, of what you find on your journey right into your online family tree if you use some genealogy apps. But also bring a notebook and some tape to create a tangible souvenir.

Finally, consider videotaping or recording your conversations with relatives you find (but remember to ask permission, because local laws can vary). You may just be creating a valuable record for the next generation of heritage travelers.
