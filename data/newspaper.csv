The victim was able to get away, and two bystanders in a grey or white vehicle helped her, York police said. York Regional Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was sexually assaulted in Vaughan on Friday, Nov. 8. Around 7 a.m., police said, the victim was waiting for a bus near Countryside Road and Bramalea Road when the suspect approached her in a black sedan, presented himself as a rideshare driver and offered her a ride. The suspect then drove the victim to the area of Highway 27 and Nashville Road in Vaughan where he sexually assaulted her, police said in a news release. The victim was able to get away, and two bystanders in a grey or white vehicle helped her. Investigators say the suspect then fled the area. The suspect is described as a man who was about five-feet-six inches tall and between 23 and 25 years of age, who had black hair, black eyes, a thin build, and a full beard approximately two inches in length. Previously, Peel police had disclosed a similar crime on the same day, saying that in Brampton around 7 a.m. Friday, an 18-year-old woman was assaulted by a man presenting himself as a rideshare driver. York Regional Police are reminding people who use ridesharing services to always verify vehicles, licence plates and drives. Anyone with information on the Vaughan incident, including bystanders, is asked to call the York Regional Police Special Victims Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071, or contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS, or leave an anonymous tip online at www.1800222tips.com.

381355a1-93bc-4228-9009-06319d9b2b18,11/11/2024,General,Uranus Might Have Experienced a Freak Event When Voyager 2 Visited,"Our understanding of Uranus might have been all wrong for nearly 40 years.

In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft zoomed past Uranus as part of a grand tour of the outer solar system. That flyby, lasting just five hours, remains to date the only visit to Uranus by a spacecraft from Earth, with much of our understanding of the planet coming from that brief encounter.

Peculiarly, as Voyager 2 soared about 50,000 miles above the planet, it found that Uranus was quite different from other worlds in the outer solar system. In particular, its protective magnetic field, known as a magnetosphere, was devoid of plasma, something prevalent around other planets.

“We observed this empty magnetosphere,” said Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And its radiation belts, regions of the planet’s magnetic field that trap high-energy particles, were surprisingly intense, something that “breaks current radiation belt theory,” Dr. Jasinski said.

Now we may know why. In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, Dr. Jasinski and his colleagues suggest that Voyager 2’s visit flyby occurred during an exceptional increase in solar activity, which caused shrinking of the planet’s magnetosphere. That created conditions at Uranus that occurred just four percent of the time in the data that the team analyzed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/science/uranus-voyager-2-flyby.html

The U.S. government’s highway safety agency is investigating complaints that engines can fail on as many as 1.4 million Honda and Acura vehicles.

The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers the 2016 through 2020 Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, as well as the 2018 through 2020 Honda Odyssey and Acura TLX. Also included is the 2017 through 2019 Honda Ridgeline.

The agency says in documents posted on its website Monday that connecting rod bearings on vehicles with 3.5-liter V6 engines can fail, leading to complete engine failure. Connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft and convert vertical motion to move the wheels.

Ad Feedback

Honda recalled about 250,000 vehicles in November of 2023 to fix the same problem. But the agency says it has 173 complaints from owners who reported connecting rod bearing failures, yet their vehicles weren’t included in the recall. One owner reported a crash with no injuries.

The agency said it’s opening a recall query to determine the severity of the problem in vehicles not included in the 2023 recall.

Ad Feedback

Honda said it will cooperate with NHTSA on the investigation.

In documents explaining the 2023 recall, the automaker said had 1,450 warranty claims due to the bearing problem but no reports of injuries. Dealers were to inspect and repair or replace the engines if needed.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/business/honda-engine-recall/index.html

2697587a-633f-4cf5-b403-8f59d2e53f4b,11/12/2024,General,Employers lock out longshore workers in Montreal after contract offer rejected,"  The Maritime Employers Association is calling on federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon to intervene to resolve the impasse at Canada’s second-biggest port.  A sign reading “closed” is shown next to the entrance to a terminal at the Port of Montreal in Montreal, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, where a lock out of dock workers has been declared by the employer.  MONTREAL - Operations at the Port of Montreal were greatly reduced Monday as the Maritime Employers Association made good on a threat to lock out nearly 1,200 longshore workers if they didn’t accept what it called a final contract offer. The lockout took effect at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and the employers’ association is asking federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon to intervene. MacKinnon’s office issued a statement Monday calling on both sides at the country’s second largest port to get back to the negotiating table. “The parties must understand the urgency of the situation and do the work necessary to reach an agreement,” his office said. “Canadians are counting on them.” The union told a news conference on Monday it is ready to return to the table as early as Tuesday. But Michel Murray, an adviser with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents the dock workers, said union overtures have received no response from the employer. Murray told a news conference simultaneous lockouts in Montreal and Vancouver seem designed to force the federal government’s hand. Port workers in British Columbia are locked out amid a labour dispute involving more than 700 longshore supervisors, resulting in a paralysis of container cargo traffic at terminals across Canada’s west coast. “We hope that the employer side will emerge from its silence of the past three weeks,” Murray said. “But clearly, when we look at what is happening, the lockout in Vancouver, the lockout in Montreal, we feel that it is a co-ordinated, planned attempt to increase the pressure on the federal government so that it intervenes in our file.” Julie Gascon, CEO of the Montreal Port Authority, warned of “catastrophic” economic consequences of a prolonged conflict. “This lockout affects not only the 1,200 longshoremen directly impacted by the work stoppage, but it also impacts over 10,000 workers in the logistics sector, from trucking and railway employees to maritime agents and pilots,” she said in a statement. “Logistics jobs are the first to be affected, which inevitably sets off a domino effect throughout the entire economy in the markets we serve.” Gascon told reporters in an early morning news conference effects will trickle down to other parts of the economy. “Today the conflict is impacting the supply chain, but tomorrow the conflict will impact factories as well, after that, it will be retailers,” she said. The Port of Montreal, which moves nearly $400 million in goods every day, said essential services will continue, with liquid bulk terminals and the grain terminal among those remaining open. The employers association in Montreal said it initiated the lockout after the unionized workers voted almost unanimously to reject a contract offer tabled last week. The workers have been without a collective agreement since Dec. 31 and had rejected two previous offers. The employer said last week its latest offer included a three-per-cent salary increase each year for four years and a 3.5 per cent increase for the two subsequent years. The employer said the increases offered would bring a longshore worker’s total average compensation to more than $200,000 per year at the end of the six-year contract. The union, the Syndicat des débardeurs du port de Montréal, called the figure exaggerated. It said the employer is focused on salaries, but what members want are improvements in scheduling and work-life balance. Members who are parents do not want to have stretches where they work 19 out of 21 days, it said. Murray said it’s time to put those previous offers — which clearly cannot be the basis of any agreement — in the “shredder” and discuss what it will take for both sides to enter into a long-term agreement. The Conseil du patronat, which represents Quebec employers, said it is very concerned about the latest work stoppage. It and a group representing manufacturers called on the federal government to intervene. “Businesses and citizens can no longer bear the cost of this situation, which is repeated too often,” the Conseil du patronat said in a statement.

However, not until you are taught a lesson in past racism, land settlement and slavery.

Even on Remembrance Day at Toronto’s Cenotaph honouring the war fallen who gave Canada its freedoms, the event couldn’t begin without a reminder of what could perhaps be the reason you don’t see many people wearing poppies in 2024.

It took a while to get around to the sacrifice of Canadian troops. There were other matters to attend to first. Namely Canadians are “settlers” who engaged in “slavery” and “discrimination.”

Article content As it said in the program, “MC Aretha Phillip, chief of protocol for the City of Toronto, brings remarks including the territorial land acknowledgment.” It lasted three minutes. “I would like to begin by acknowledging the Indigenous people of these lands,” Phillip said. “It’s important that we reaffirm our commitment and responsibility to improving relations between nations and learning about the rich history of this land to better understand our role as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers in this place we each call home.”

Article content “The City of Toronto acknowledges the land we are meeting on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. We also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit. We also acknowledge the Williams treaties, signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands. “The City of Toronto also acknowledges all treaty peoples including those who came here as settlers, as migrants either in this generation or generations past including those of us who came here involuntarily, particularly those brought to these lands as a result of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. We pay tribute to ancestors of African origin and descent. In keeping with this tribute during this remembrance week, the city commemorated the contribution of No. 2 Construction Battalion, Canada’s only all-Black battalion. Despite facing discrimination, these brave men took up the call to serve during the First World War more than 100 years ago and we are joined today by their descendants.”

d1d961e1-3b79-44c6-b3f2-74ecdabd4bcb,11/12/2024,General,Blue state Democrats issue scathing reflection on election loss: 'We're out of touch',"Two blue state Democrats in Congress issued blistering assessments of where their party stands after Tuesday night’s overwhelming election defeat and offered suggestions about changes that Democrats need to make.

""That was a cataclysm,"" Connecticut Sen. Chis Murphy posted on X . ""Electoral map wipeout. Senate D practical ceiling is now 52 seats. R's is 62.""

""Time to rebuild the left,"" Murphy wrote. ""We are out of touch with the crisis of meaning/purpose fueling MAGA. We refuse to pick big fights. Our tent is too small.""

In a lengthy X thread that had more than 7 million views on Monday morning, Murphy said Democrats ""don't listen enough; we tell people what's good for them"" and skip ""past the way people are feeling (alone, impotent, overwhelmed) and straight to uninspiring solutions (more roads! bulk drug purchasing!) that do little to actually upset the status quo of who has power and who doesn't.""

HARRIS PAID OPRAH $1 MILLION IN FAILED BID TO HELP CAMPAIGN: REPORT

Murphy acknowledged a disconnect between everyday working class voters and the ""elites"" and suggested the party needs to more openly embrace candidates who reject the status quo.

""And when progressives like Bernie aggressively go after the elites that hold people down, they are shunned as dangerous populists,"" Murphy wrote. ""Why? Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base.""

""We cannot be afraid of fights – especially with the economic elites who have profited off neoliberalism. The right regularly picks fights with elites – Hollywood, higher ed, etc. Democrats (e.g. the Harris campaign) are tepid in our fights with billionaires and corporations.""

MARK CUBAN, MAVERICKS MINORITY OWNER AND HARRIS SURROGATE, TAKES HEAT FOR DELETING SUPPORTIVE POSTS OF VP

Murphy told his followers that ""real economic populism should be our tentpole.""

""Those are hard things for the left,"" Murphy wrote in the final post of the thread. ""A firm break with neoliberalism. Listen to poor and rural people, men in crisis. Don't decide for them. Pick fights. Embrace populism. Build a big tent. Be less judgmental. But we are beyond small fixes.""

New York Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan, who won re-election in New York’s 18th Congressional District despite the red wave that swept across most of the country, also put forward a post-mortem on social media that was seen by millions of users.

""First and foremost, if you're using the words ‘moderate’ or ‘progressive’ you're missing the whole f***ing point,"" Ryan wrote on X . ""It's not ideological. It's about who fights for the people vs. who further empowers and enables the elites.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Ryan explained his take on why he was able to win as a Democrat in a pro-Republican climate and said he ""put affordability front and center every day.""

""Most importantly, I told folks exactly who it was that was ripping them off, and I grounded it locally. It's the billionaires and big corporations making record-breaking profits while the rest of us struggle.""

Ryan wrote, ""It's not enough to throw these seemingly disparate policies at people. We must articulate a unifying principle, and clearly tell folks who’s at fault. For me, it was Freedom. and Patriotism. And the fault lies with the same elites, in both parties, who've run this country for far too long.""

Various camps within the Democratic Party have been pointing fingers at each other Democrat presidential candidate Vice President Harris' loss to President-elect Donald Trump last week.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pinned blame for the loss on the Democratic Party for ""abandoning"" the working class, sparking a rebuke from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

""It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,"" Sanders posted to X last week, accompanied by a press release on the election results. ""And they’re right.""

Pelosi responded that the party has not left the working class behind in favor of kowtowing to ""big-money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party,"" as Sanders had argued in his press release.

""With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families. That's where we are,"" Pelosi told the New York Times' ""The Interview"" podcast on Saturday.

Press freedom groups have a stark warning for Americans: Trump could pose a serious threat to fact-based journalism during his next term in office if he does not change course.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and Freedom of the Press Foundation all issued statements in the aftermath of Trump’s win this week, urging the ex- and soon-to-be president and his administration to commit to respecting the free press during the next four years. “Attacking the press is really an attack on American citizens’ right to know,” Reporters Without Borders Executive Director Clayton Weimers said in a statement. “Trump’s new administration can and must change its tune with the media and take concrete steps to protect journalists and develop a climate conducive to a robust and pluralistic news media.”

This will be a tall order for Trump: At a rally just last weekend, he said he would be OK with a crowd of journalists being shot at, as I reported at the time. His communications director, Steven Cheung, tried to clean up his comments by implausibly alleging that Trump “was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!” From early September until the end of October, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times, Reporters Without Borders found in an analysis published last month. Trump has repeatedly derided journalists as “fake news” and the media as “the enemy of the people.” And as my colleague Pema Levy reported, Trump also launched what experts said was a frivolous lawsuit against CBS News last month, alleging that producers unfairly edited a 60 Minutes interview with his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, to make her look better. His campaign also submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission claiming that the Washington Post was running a paid advertising campaign to boost stories critical of Trump; a Post spokesperson said the allegations were “improper” and “without merit.” CNN also reported that Trump has called at least 15 times for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks he dislikes.

All this makes it no wonder, then, that Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s reelection “marks a dangerous moment for American journalism and global press freedom.” The Committee to Protect Journalists struck a similar tone. “Legal persecution, imprisonment, physical violence, and even killings have sadly become familiar threats for journalists across the world,” its statement said. “They must not now also become commonplace in the United States, where threats of violence and online harassment have in recent years become routine.” And Freedom of the Press Foundation claimed that Trump “will try to destroy press freedom”; as the group noted, Trump will have an ally in Elon Musk, who has spread pro-Trump disinformation on his platform to the tune of billions of views in the lead-up to Election Day. More recently, Musk has taken to telling everyday X users that they are the media now and “citizen journalism is the future.” (Apparently his conception of journalism sees conspiracy theories as acceptable and fact-checks as unnecessary.)

This all comes at a time when Republicans, and young people, are as likely to trust social media as a news source as they are to trust national news outlets, according to data published last month from Pew Research Center. The Trump campaign and the GOP have both contributed to and capitalized on this distrust, with Trump launching his own social media network, Truth Social, in 2022, and eschewing the cable news sit-downs Harris did during the campaign for interviews with right-wing male podcasters, who likely helped him make massive gains among young men this year. Media outlets hoping to win back the trust of these voters, though, will not just have podcasters and social media to compete with: One of their biggest adversaries will likely be Trump himself.

Nearly two years after the mobbing attack that left 59-year-old homeless man Kenneth Lee dead, the matter is still making its way through the courts. Toronto cops said Lee was swarmed and then stabbed to death near Union Station over defending a friend who was guarding her bottle of booze. Four of the youths have since pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the case: Three to manslaughter and one to assault causing bodily harm. Next year, the remaining quartet will stand trial.

Article content Noted Toronto criminal lawyer Monte MacGregor — who has been involved in dozens of murder trials — told the Toronto Sun why he thinks the girls would opt for a judge. “You want a judge when you have a better case on the law, you want a jury when you have a better case on the facts,” MacGregor told the Sun. “It’s likely that the ones who opted for judge alone are not the stabber (the one that was directly responsible for causing the death). In law, you can be charged because you are the principal that caused the death or you can be considered a party to the offence by aiding or assisting in causing the death.” In the riddle of the Wayward Teen Girls, you opt for the judge, the lawyer said. “In this case, you would likely want a judge over a jury if you were not the stabber because you would argue that you … didn’t know that the stabber had a knife and was going to use it to cause the death,” MacGregor said.

Article content “A judge is supposed to look past the heinous nature of the offence and solely assess the case on the law without injecting emotion. A jury may convict someone far more easily by relying more on emotion and not adhering to the strict letter of the law.” And the murder of Ken Lee was very, very emotional, with one veteran detective telling me he thought the alleged killers were “animals.” According to cops, Lee was attacked by a rabid wolfpack of teen girls, high on booze and attitude, shortly after midnight on Dec. 18, 2022, in a parkette near University Ave. and Front St. after he came to the aid of a female friend who’d been robbed of her alcohol.

Article content Of course, the accused can’t be identified because of the trainwreck known as the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Keep in mind, Ken Lee was stabbed in the heart. His body had 19 different wounds from blunt-force trauma. And now, sometime in the new year, his family will once again be dragged through his horrifying final minutes on this earth. The accused? If convicted they will do a few months — if any time — in juvie, get a blast of street cred and move on. Possibly to more horrors. “The key in selecting a judge is that the defence will focus on the lack of overall contribution by the individual participant and will argue that the death was not foreseeable — essentially, they didn’t know the stabber was going to use the knife,” MacGregor explained. “Aiming for a not guilty or at its highest a manslaughter — not a murder conviction.” bhunter@postmedia.com @HunterTOSun

Tom Homan, President-elect Trump’s pick for “border czar” in his upcoming administration, pushed back against critics of his immigration ideology.

Fox Business’s Elizabeth MacDonald showed recent clips featuring MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace saying Homan has “ties to Project 2025,” former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro saying he has “a cowboy attitude” and that Trump’s deportation plan will “require a lot of pushback” and “The View” co-host Ana Navarro saying “when he says ‘Yes, families can be deported together,’ what he is saying, is that U.S. citizens can be deported.”

“Are you saying that, Tom?” MacDonald asked Homan on “The Evening Edit,” referring to Navarro’s statement.

Homan responded that “U.S. citizens” and “legal immigrants are perfectly safe, for God’s sakes.”

Late last month, in response to a question from journalist Cecilia Vega on CBS’s “60 Minutes” about the possibility of going forward with “mass deportation without separating families,” Homan said “there is” and that “Families can be deported together.”

Earlier in his interview on “The Evening Edit,” Homan said the Biden administration has “deported families together.”

“I mean, look … if these people demand due process, they demand the right to claim asylum, they demand the right [to see a judge], and we give them to ‘em at an [exorbitant] taxpayer cost, at the end of that due process, if [a] federal judge [says] ‘You must go home,’ they have to go home,” Homan added. “If they don’t, then what the hell are we doing?”",https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4985195-trumps-border-czar-to-critics-legal-immigrants-are-perfectly-safe/
1de70599-86d1-4992-962d-cf89026d5f71,11/12/2024,Technology,Arm is giving Qualcomm the wake-up call it needs,"Arm is the company inside every phone you can buy today. It designed the processor architecture that companies like Qualcomm, Apple, Google, and MediaTek use to build chips, as well as the processors from companies like Nvidia that power the AI future. They're a pretty big deal. That's why Nvidia tried to use its deep pockets to buy Arm outright in a deal that was thankfully blocked by the FTC.

They also gave Qualcomm a 60-day notice to stop making those chips. Yes, the company that powers a large portion of phones and tablets around the globe has to stop making the main product it sells. Maybe.

Of course, each side is quick to say why they are on the right, and the other side isn't. Qualcomm says in a statement:

This is more of the same from ARM – more unfounded threats designed to strongarm a longtime partner, interfere with our performance-leading CPUs, and increase royalty rates regardless of the broad rights under our architecture license. With a trial fast approaching in December, Arm’s desperate ploy appears to be an attempt to disrupt the legal process, and its claim for termination is completely baseless. We are confident that Qualcomm’s rights under its agreement with Arm will be affirmed. Arm’s anticompetitive conduct will not be tolerated.

And Arm's statement:

Following Qualcomm’s repeated material breaches of Arm’s license agreement, Arm is left with no choice but to take formal action requiring Qualcomm to remedy its breach or face termination of the agreement. This is necessary to protect the unparalleled ecosystem that Arm and its highly valued partners have built over more than 30 years. Arm is fully prepared for the trial in December and remains confident that the Court will find in Arm’s favor.

Let's be real for a minute — this won't happen. The two companies will reach a last-minute agreement that allows Qualcomm to keep making chips because Qualcomm is dead if they're forced to stop making money. This is Arm playing hardball with Qualcomm because it thinks Qualcomm was playing fast and loose with the terms of a contract.

How did we get to this point? In 2021 Qualcomm spent $1.4 billion to buy Nuvia, a company that designed and built high-powered Arm chips for servers. The acquisition itself was a little touch and go because Nuvia's founder was a chip designer for Apple and was under an agreement that the company would not build chips that compete with Apple products.

(Image credit: Source: Qualcomm)

There was a problem though. Nuvia had a license from Arm to use the company's architecture and original designs, which Arm says was not transferrable. Qualcomm claimed differently and integrated Nuvia's work into its own chips without renegotiating a new contract. It sounds really dumb to us, but Arm says Qualcomm wasn't legally allowed to use the ideas it paid for because they were based on ideas of another company. This is the type of thing that allows lawyers to exist.

Arm kept saying you have to come to the table for new terms, Qualcomm kept saying nope, and now Arm has had enough and says Qualcomm can no longer use its intellectual property 60 days from now.

Now, to the part why this isn't going to happen. Qualcomm depends on Arm, but Arm considers Qualcomm just another customer. In 61 days if Qualcomm stops making Arm chips for phones, tablets, laptops, routers, and every other gadget you can imagine Arm still has plenty of other customers. Arm would surely feel the loss financially and it's possible that Qualcomm would sue for the return of money paid for the rest of any contract, but Apple, Nvidia, Samsung, MediaTek, and a slew of other companies would keep chugging along and continue to pay Arm.

You can see where this is going: Qualcomm needs Arm. Arm doesn't need Qualcomm. The two companies working together is lucrative for both sides, but if the partnership ends Arm will survive.

Qualcomm will do whatever it takes to keep on making chips. Maybe Qualcomm should have complied with Arm's wishes sooner, but Qualcomm is no stranger to litigation and acting the bully when it comes to the chip industry. It's a tactic that has worked in the past and a strategy to continue to use until it stops working. Qualcomm makes some fabulous products, but its business practices aren't nearly as wonderful.

(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)

Other companies would be affected if Qualcomm drops off the face of the chip world, too. Some, like Apple and other chip makers, would benefit by way of more foundry time to have their own chips built (unless the U.S. government shuts TSMC down, that is) or gain a new set of customers. Others, like phone manufacturers or companies that make IoT devices, would suffer because they've designed products for a component that's no longer available. Switching to an alternative is expensive and difficult.

Consumers would suffer. Imagine a Galaxy S25 launch with extremely limited availability because there just isn't enough of Samsung's own chips available to make 100 million new phones. Other companies that don't also build in-house chips would have it even worse and scramble to incorporate another product as the heart of their new phone.

Killing off Qualcomm's main business would be a disaster for the consumer market. Both sides know it, just as they know an agreement has to be reached.

In the meantime, it's always fun to see the big dog squirm a little bit. Arm leveraging the proverbial worst-case scenario to get Qualcomm to comply is more entertaining than business as usual.",https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-giving-qualcomm-the-wake-up-call-it-needs

The SU7's cabin is high-tech and thoroughly modern. Though Xiaomi is best known outside China for its smartphones, the consumer-electronics conglomerate makes everything from TVs and smart speakers to connected housewares like lights and air conditioners.

As part of the Xiaomi ecosystem, the SU7 is integrated with the company's other products, allowing for remote voice control of household appliances from the vehicle.

In front of the driver is a small 7.1-inch rotating digital instrument cluster and a gigantic 56-inch head-up display projected onto the SU7's windshield. Atop its center stack is a massive 16.1-inch infotainment screen with smartphone mirroring. The SU7's rear cabin is equipped with seatback mounting points for tablets that can be connected to the car's infotainment system.

The SU7 also offers Xiaomi Pilot, software that the company says allows for assisted self-driving and self-parking.

The Model 3's cabin is a demonstration of high-tech minimalism. The entire in-car experience is focused on the Tesla's 15.4-inch central touchscreen, which serves as both the instrument display and its infotainment screen. Rear-seat passengers can have access to their own eight-inch touchscreen with entertainment options and climate controls.

The Model 3 also comes with handy features like Sentry Mode, which monitors the vehicle's surroundings, and Dog Mode, which keeps your pets safe while you're away from the car.

As with all Teslas, the Model 3 comes with the company's signature Autopilot semi-autonomous driving tech.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model3-vs-chinese-ev-xiaomi-su7-compared-2024-11#the-tesla-and-xiaomi-have-similar-looks-2
0fedbc35-680d-4cdb-a97a-4c1ae6160aeb,7/2/2024,Technology,Would you buy an affordable EV made in China?,"As the federal government mulls whether to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, some Canadians say they would jump at the chance to buy a cheaper Chinese-branded EV manufactured in that country.

Ottawa held a month-long consultation in July on how to handle Beijing's powerful presence in the EV sector. Tariffs are among the options on the table.

Michael Wawrykowicz, who lives in Edmonton, uses a small Mitsubishi EV he bought second-hand four years ago for short trips around the city.

""For commuting, it's been great,"" he said in an interview, adding that maintenance costs have been minimal. ""In the past couple of years, I've only bought tires and washer fluid for it, and I plug it into the block heater at work.""

Wawrykowicz said he would be keen to buy an electric vehicle from China with improved range, if the price was right.

BYD, a Chinese car manufacturing giant, debuted its Seagull EV last year at a starting price of about $14,600 Cdn for a 305-kilometre-range version. The cheapest options available in Canada, by contrast, start at roughly $38,000 .

Wawrykowicz was among the callers on CBC's Cross Country Checkup on Sunday in favour of lower-cost EV options from China.

Cross Country Checkup 1:51:20 Would you buy an affordable EV made in China?

Barbara MacLellan, who lives in Colwood, B.C., bought her first EV more than a decade ago and has been championing them ever since. She told the radio program that an influx of Chinese vehicles would help spur competition in Canada.

""The problem has been that legacy automakers have not stepped up to the plate on this,"" MacLellan said. ""It's not early days. We are late to this. We are seeing the climate change now.""

Questions about Chinese government's record

Others were opposed to opening the market to Chinese EVs, expressing safety concerns or citing China's human rights record.

Morgan Whittall, a paramedic in Barrie, Ont., argued it doesn't make sense to buy an EV from a country with such poor environmental policies.

""You're not really getting what you're paying for when you're saying, 'I'm doing this for climate change,' but you're buying it from a place that really isn't considering how their process is affecting the climate,"" he said.

China emits roughly one-third of the world's carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has also become a world leader in solar and wind energy, along with electric vehicles.

A recent report from the Finnish think-tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air projected that 2024 could be the year emissions in China start to fall.

WATCH | Canada creating plan to crack down on Chinese EV imports: Canada creating plan to crack down on Chinese EV imports Duration 2:03 The federal government is starting consultations to determine how Canada can best stop an oversupply of Chinese-made electric vehicles from flooding the Canadian market. But the promise comes long after increased tariffs on the EVs in the EU and the U.S.

The Finance Department's consultation period wrapped up Aug. 1.

The consultation also included consideration of whether vehicles made in China should be eligible for federal incentives for zero-emission vehicles, such as the rebates of up to $5,000 available to Canadians who buy or lease an EV.

Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokesperson for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, said that ""all options — including a surtax — are on the table to protect Canadian workers and EV supply chains from unfair competition from China's intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity and lack of rigorous labour and environmental standards.""

""We will have more to say soon.""

High stakes for economy and climate

The stakes are high. Since 2020, Canada has attracted more than $46 billion in investments for 13 electric vehicle, battery and battery component manufacturing projects, according to a June 18 report from the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer.

The same report says that Ottawa and the provinces have jointly promised up to $53 billion in return, including tax credits, production subsidies and capital investments. Industry groups, such as the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, warn all of that could be at risk if the industry isn't protected.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was on hand in September 2023 for the announcement of a new electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility by Northvolt in Quebec. The federal government has bet big on EV cars and battery plants. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada)

""We are gaining a foothold in this emerging industry, and we're doing that in partnership with our American partners and allies,"" Brian Kingston, the group's president, told Cross Country Checkup.

""If we do not take action now to give these facilities time to come online to allow manufacturers to build up their production capacity, we put up all that investment at risk.""

Industry groups in the United States have expressed similar concerns. A report earlier this year from the Alliance for American Manufacturing said government-subsidized Chinese EVs ""could end up being an extinction-level event for the U.S. auto sector."" The U.S. imposed a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese EVs earlier this year, up from 25 per cent.

Environmental groups, such as Environmental Defence, have argued that blocking the entry of Chinese EVs will make them more expensive, delaying Canada's transition to a low-carbon economy. Last year, the Liberals committed to end the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2035.

George S. Takach, an expert on technology and the law, is the author of several books, including Cold War 2.0: Artificial Intelligence in the New Battle Between China, Russia and America.

The Canadian government is considering a surtax to prevent Chinese electric vehicles from flooding the market, just as the U.S. and the European Union have done recently. But there’s much more at stake than just the competitive position of the North American auto industry. Looking back at recent disputes between China and Western democracies, it’s clear that security issues also need to be considered.

The U.S. government recently decided to ban the social media app TikTok if it isn’t sold to a government-approved buyer, in part because it collects user information that could get into the hands of the Chinese government. For its part, the Chinese government has long banned the use of Facebook, Google, YouTube and many other American tech services in China.

In 2021, China directed government employees to stop driving their Teslas to work because cameras and other sensors on the vehicle could be used to obtain sensitive information about the facilities the car was driven into, like a military base or highly sensitive research campus.

More recently, the U.S. government has expressed concern that “connected cranes” in American ports could be hacked by foreign adversaries because of the sophisticated software they use and the reams of data they generate.

A few years ago, governments in many democracies, including Canada and the U.S., banned the use of Chinese-made telecommunications equipment, including from Huawei, because of similar concerns. In 2018, the U.S. banned the use of Chinese-made security cameras at military bases for the same reasons.

Do you see a pattern?

These actions are a part of the massive technology decoupling that is under way between the autocracies and the democracies. It doesn’t extend to most Chinese-made products you can buy in Walmart, such as shower curtains. Equally, China has no such concerns about the agricultural products they buy from Canada.

High-tech goods, however, pose an altogether different risk profile, especially if the item or service collects data, images, and other information. This is what the products and services noted above have in common.

This is also precisely what EVs do today. The typical EV, whether made in China or elsewhere, has about a dozen cameras (some inside as well), a similar number of ultrasonic sensors and radar, and literally several thousand semiconductor chips that operate software and collect and process vast quantities of data, including geolocation information. A foreign government getting access to this tech environment – or a foreign hacker – could find out all sorts of things about drivers, their environs, their contacts and their employers.

Or the foreign government might order the car company to implement a software hack, causing all cars to immediately cease operation, perhaps during the early stages of a national security crisis, such as a diplomatic or military confrontation over the future of Taiwan.

These concerns are real and should be taken seriously by the democracies, just as the Chinese government did when they directed certain government employees to stop driving their Teslas to work. Moreover, the danger is not diminished if the Chinese EV is made in Mexico, just as the TikTok risk is not solved by having data stored on a server in Singapore rather than Shanghai.

These concerns, and several other similar ones, will drive the democracies to eventually eliminate trade with China involving modern technologies. This will be an unfortunate end state, because trade in high-tech offerings between China and the democracies could be a huge win-win for both camps.

Nevertheless, so long as the autocrats currently in power in China (and Moscow, Iran and North Korea) continue to refuse to comply with the norms of the rules-based international order (witness the invasion of Ukraine, grey zone military actions in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, massive disinformation campaigns, the supply of weapons to terrorist groups, constant cyber attacks and the unjust detention of foreign citizens) the great tech decoupling will continue, including in the EV domain.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-chinese-evs-arent-just-an-economic-threat-they-are-a-security-risk/
d7f4101a-e988-4013-8f5b-4f3a0cc24231,11/12/2024,Technology,Opinion: Canada must look beyond EV tariffs and force China to play by global trade rules,"Open this photo in gallery: BYD electric vehicles at the port of Lianyungang, in Jiangsu province, China, on April 25.China Daily CDIC/Reuters

Guy Saint-Jacques served as Canada’s ambassador to China from 2012 to 2016.

The decision by the Canadian government to impose 100-per-cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles was to be expected. Because of its deep economic integration with the United States (and the possibility that Donald Trump will be the next U.S. president), Ottawa had no choice on Monday but to align with the American position by imposing such tariffs.

But we must recognize that this is an issue bigger than EVs. That’s why Ottawa also announced 25-per-cent tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel. We have already seen how China has created a near-monopoly on solar power components, to name only one sector, and destroyed foreign competition.

For the past 40 years, and especially since it joined the WTO in 2001, China’s economic success has been based on exports supported when necessary by subsidies of various kinds. In 2015, President Xi Jinping enunciated the Made-in-China 2025 policy to not only reduce Chinese dependency on imports in 10 technological sectors, but also to become a net exporter of these technologies, EVs being one of them. The Chinese economic model encourages overcapacity as its provinces and local officials compete among themselves to create jobs and boost economic growth, with Beijing unable to fully co-ordinate economic development. And China still encourages the acquisition of foreign technology by all means, including theft.

China got a free ride for a long time by occasionally giving piecemeal concessions to foreigners and timely contracts to detract criticism. But China needs to recognize it would pay a price for not playing by the rules – such as giving large subsidies to manufacturers and very slowly removing barriers to allow foreign companies into the Chinese market, despite promises to open it after joining the WTO.

Beijing needs to learn it faces wide-ranging consequences; there have been few consequences so far as foreign governments have been reluctant to take China to the WTO when it did not follow the rules. (There are a number of cases that Canada should have pursued when restrictions were imposed on Canadian products after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou in 2018). As Mr. Xi is more preoccupied by national security, that is preserving the survival of the Communist Party, we should not expect rapid progress in adherence to the rules even if foreign investment in China has been dropping significantly in recent years.

In many ways, we are dealing with a government in Beijing that is immature and does not know how to act responsibly as a major power. Its fallback position has been to act as a bully and use coercive measures against countries that dare to confront it. The Canadian government knows it is not in a comfortable position: the United States remains by far our No. 1 export destination, despite the goals of the Indo-Pacific Strategy; the search for new markets in Asia is moving slowly, while our exports to China keep growing; and China remains an important part of the supply chain of many of our companies.

Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly is trying to rebuild some bridges with China and she should be commended for that, but progress will be limited as the chemistry between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mr. Xi is very bad. Restoring a minimum of dialogue is important for our interests while continuing to press China to improve its human-rights record. We need to explain to them that not doing so and not playing by the rules will prevent China from becoming a great power.

So a goal for Canada (we could call it the level-playing-field policy) should be to work with other countries to force China to play by the rules and, in exchange, we would welcome their products more openly. This would also require an effort to revitalize the WTO so it can play its role more effectively.

In the meantime, it is too bad Canadian consumers cannot benefit from Chinese EVs that are well made and very affordable. As the transportation sector represents a large part of GHG emissions in Canada, getting more EVs on the market should be a priority. Let’s hope we can return to a situation where people can enjoy the benefits of (clean) globalization.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canada-must-look-beyond-ev-tariffs-and-force-china-to-play-by-global/

OpenAI's next flagship artificial-intelligence model is showing smaller improvements compared with previous iterations, The Information reported, in a sign that the booming generative-AI industry may be approaching a plateau.

The ChatGPT maker's next model, Orion, showed only a moderate improvement over GPT-4, The Information said, citing some employees who have used or tested it. The leap in Orion has been smaller than that between GPT-3 and GPT-4, especially in coding tasks, the report added.

It reignites a debate about the feasibility of developing increasingly advanced models and AI scaling laws — the theoretical rules about how the models improve.

Advertisement

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on X in February that ""scaling laws are decided by god; the constants are determined by members of the technical staff.""

The ""laws"" Altman cited suggest AI models become smarter as they size up and get access to more data and computing power.

Altman may still subscribe to the view that a preordained formula decides how much smarter AI can get, but The Information's report showed technical staff were questioning those laws amid a fierce debate in Silicon Valley over growing evidence that leading models are hitting a performance wall.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Have scaling laws hit a dead end?

While Orion's training is not yet complete, OpenAI has nonetheless reverted to additional measures to boost performance, such as baking in post-training improvements based on human feedback, The Information said.

The model, first unveiled a year ago, could still see dramatic improvements ahead of its release. But it's a sign that future generations of AI models that have helped companies raise billions of dollars and command lofty valuations may look less impressive with each iteration.

There are two main reasons this could happen.

Altman is a firm believer in ""scaling laws."" Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images

Data, one vital element of the scaling-law equation, has been harder to come by as companies have quickly exhausted available data online.

They have scraped vast amounts of human-created data — including text, videos, research papers, and novels — to train the models behind their AI tools and features, but the supply is limited. The research firm Epoch AI predicted in June that firms could exhaust usable textual data by 2028. Companies are trying to overcome constraints by turning to synthetic data generated by AI itself, but that, too, comes with problems.

""For general-knowledge questions, you could argue that for now we are seeing a plateau in the performance of LLMs,"" Ion Stoica, a cofounder and the executive chair of the enterprise-software firm Databricks, told The Information, adding that ""factual data"" was more useful than synthetic data.

Computing power, the other factor that has historically boosted AI performance, is also not limitless. In a Reddit ""ask me anything"" thread last month, Altman acknowledged that his company faced ""a lot of limitations and hard decisions"" about allocating its computing resources.

It's no wonder that some industry experts have been starting to note that AI models released this year, as well as future ones, show evidence of producing smaller leaps in performance than their predecessors.

'Diminishing returns'

Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus and outspoken critic of AI hype, argues AI development is destined to hit a wall. He has been vocal about his belief that it shows signs of ""diminishing returns"" and reacted to The Information's reporting with a Substack post headlined ""CONFIRMED: LLMs have indeed reached a point of diminishing returns.""

Related stories

When OpenAI's rival Anthropic released its Claude 3.5 model in June, Marcus dismissed an X post showing Claude 3.5's performance with marginal improvements over competitors in areas like graduate-level reasoning, code, and multilingual math. He said it was in the ""same ballpark as many others.""

The AI market has spent billions of dollars trying to upend the competition, only for it to deliver evidence for ""convergence, rather than continued exponential growth,"" Marcus said.

Ilya Sutskever, a cofounder of OpenAI and Safe Superintelligence, has suggested a similar notion. On Monday following The Information's report, he told Reuters that results from scaling up pretraining had plateaued, adding: ""Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.""

The AI industry will keep looking for ways to spark huge jumps in performance. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted that AI-model training runs will enter a new era next year in which they could cost $100 billion. Altman previously said it cost more than $100 million to train GPT-4. It remains to be seen how smart an AI model can get when it has that much capital thrown at it.

Scaling optimism

Other Silicon Valley leaders, including Altman, are still publicly optimistic about AI's scaling potential. In July, Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, dismissed concerns that AI progress had plateaued. ""Despite what other people think, we're not at diminishing marginal returns on scale-up,"" Scott said during an interview with Sequoia Capital's ""Training Data"" podcast.

There could also be strategies to make AI models smarter by enhancing the inference portion of development. Inference is the work done to refine AI outputs once they've been trained, via data they haven't seen before.

The model OpenAI released in September — called OpenAI o1 — focused more on inference improvements. It managed to outperform its predecessors in complex tasks, achieving a level of intelligence similar to that of Ph.D. students on benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology, OpenAI said.

Still, it's clear that, like Altman, much of the industry remains firm in its conviction that scaling laws are the driver of AI performance. If future models underwhelm, expect a reassessment of the boom.",https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-orion-model-scaling-law-silicon-valley-chatgpt-2024-11

Every Monday, we answer a question from our readers. Send your question to tomislav@mixed.de with ""Question"" in the subject line, and with any luck, we'll answer it the following Monday.

This week's question comes from Marc Lange:

""Do you think VR and AR have a lasting future, or is it a fleeting phenomenon?""

""Hello Marc

Virtual reality existed long before the current wave that started in 2012, and was used for simulation, visualization, design, research, and training. With the advent of low-cost, consumer-oriented VR headsets since 2016, these areas have grown, and I expect virtual reality to remain a fixture in these areas regardless of market developments in the coming years and decades.

The more interesting question you probably were aiming at is whether virtual reality will be able to establish itself in the consumer market in the long term, with so many media, gadgets and digital forms of entertainment vying for our attention.

As I wrote last week, the VR market is currently dominated by Meta. Meta Quest is the leading VR platform where most developers make their money. I believe that as long as these developers remain profitable and Meta stays in virtual reality, virtual reality will continue to exist and grow as a consumer-oriented entertainment and computing platform. But these are ifs.

Meta has made virtual reality relatively successful with aggressive investments and subsidies, distorting expectations and prices at the same time. If Meta took into account the cost of R&D and added a healthy margin, VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3S would easily cost twice as much or more. We don't know how much money Meta spends on the VR division alone, but it's safe to assume it's still a money-losing business. Until that changes and other manufacturers can turn consumer virtual reality into a profitable business, I remain cautious about making long-term predictions.

For now, those who benefit are the developers who make a good profit from VR games (and there are many, rest assured), and of course, we consumers who can get hardware and software at an incredible value ratio. However, we should be aware that Meta is essentially still investing in virtual reality and can also stop that investment with likely devastating consequences for the fledgling computing platform. What is true for virtual reality is even more true for augmented reality, which is much further away from true mass adoption and profitability.

Do I think VR and AR can become mainstream in the long term? Absolutely. But I can't say when that will be. As someone who has been a journalist in the industry for almost ten years and has followed the technological developments, I no longer think in terms of years, but decades. From that perspective, we may still be at the very beginning.

Kind regards,

Tomislav

e2274902-e94f-42b6-bab0-2a319a663404,11/8/2024,Technology,The Death of Search,"For nearly two years, the world’s biggest tech companies have said that AI will transform the web, your life, and the world. But first, they are remaking the humble search engine.

Chatbots and search, in theory, are a perfect match. A standard Google search interprets a query and pulls up relevant results; tech companies have spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars engineering chatbots that interpret human inputs, synthesize information, and provide fluent, useful responses. No more keyword refining or scouring Wikipedia—ChatGPT will do it all. Search is an appealing target, too: Shaping how people navigate the internet is tantamount to shaping the internet itself.

Months of prophesying about generative AI have now culminated, almost all at once, in what may be the clearest glimpse yet into the internet’s future. After a series of limited releases and product demos, mired with various setbacks and embarrassing errors, tech companies are debuting AI-powered search engines as fully realized, all-inclusive products. Last Monday, Google announced that it would launch its AI Overviews in more than 100 new countries; that feature will now reach more than 1 billion users a month. Days later, OpenAI announced a new search function in ChatGPT, available to paid users for now and soon opening to the public. The same afternoon, the AI-search start-up Perplexity shared instructions for making its “answer engine” the default search tool in your web browser.

Read: The AI search war has begun

For the past week, I have been using these products in a variety of ways: to research articles, follow the election, and run everyday search queries. In turn I have scried, as best I can, into the future of how billions of people will access, relate to, and synthesize information. What I’ve learned is that these products are at once unexpectedly convenient, frustrating, and weird. These tools’ current iterations surprised and, at times, impressed me, yet even when they work perfectly, I’m not convinced that AI search is a wise endeavor.

For decades, the search bar has been a known entity. People around the world are accustomed to it; several generations implicitly regard Google as the first and best way to learn about basically anything. Enter a query, sift through a list of links, type a follow-up query, get more links, and so on until your question is answered or inquiry satisfied. That indirectness and wide aperture—all that clicking and scrolling—are in some ways the defining qualities of a traditional Google search, allowing (even forcing) you to traverse the depth and breadth of connections that justify the term world-wide web. The hyperlink, in this sense, is the building block of the modern internet.

That sprawl is lovely when you are going down a rabbit hole about Lucrezia de Medici, as I did when traveling in Florence last year, or when diving deep into a scientific dilemma. It is perfect for stumbling across delightful video clips and magazine features and social-media posts. And it is infuriating when you just need a simple biographical answer, or a brunch recommendation without the backstory of three different chefs, or a quick gloss of a complex research area without having to wade through obscure papers.

In recent years, more and more Google Search users have noted that the frustrations outweigh the delight—describing a growing number of paid advertisements, speciously relevant links engineered to top the search algorithm, and erroneous results. Generative AI promises to address those moments of frustration by providing a very different experience. Asking ChatGPT to search the web for the reasons Kamala Harris lost the presidential election yielded a short list with four factors: “economic concerns,” “demographic shifts,” “swing state dynamics,” and “campaign strategies.” It was an easy and digestible response, but not a particularly insightful one; in response to a follow-up question about voter demographics, ChatGPT provided a stream of statistics without context or analysis. A similar Google search, meanwhile, pulls up a wide range of news analyses that you have to read through. If you do follow Google’s links, you will develop a much deeper understanding of the American economy and politics.

Another example: Recently, I’ve been reading about a controversial proposed infrastructure project in Maryland. Google searches sent me through a labyrinth of public documents, corporate pitches, and hours-long recordings of city-council meetings, which took ages to review but sparked curiosity and left me deeply informed. ChatGPT, when asked, whipped up an accurate summary and timeline of events, and cited its sources—which was an extremely useful way to organize the reading I’d already done, but on its own might have been the end of my explorations.

I have long been a critic of AI-powered search. The technology has repeatedly fabricated information and struggled to accurately attribute its sources. Its creators have been accused of plagiarizing and violating the intellectual-property rights of major news organizations. None of these concerns has been fully allayed: The new ChatGPT search function, in my own use and other reports, has made some errors, mixing up dates, misreporting sports scores, and telling me that Brooklyn’s Prospect Park is bigger than Manhattan’s (much larger) Central Park. The links offered by traditional search engines are filled with errors too—but searchbots implicitly ask for your trust without verification. The citations don’t particularly invite you to click on them. And while OpenAI and Perplexity have entered into partnerships with any number of media organizations, including The Atlantic—perhaps competing for the high-quality, human-made content that their searchbots depend on—exactly how websites that once relied on ad revenue and subscriptions will fare on an AI-filtered web eludes me. (The editorial division of The Atlantic operates independently from the business division, which announced its corporate partnership with OpenAI in May.)

Read: AI search is turning into the problem everyone worried about

Although ChatGPT and Perplexity and Google AI Overviews cite their sources with (small) footnotes or bars to click on, not clicking on those links is the entire point. OpenAI, in its announcement of its new search feature, wrote that “getting useful answers on the web can take a lot of effort. It often requires multiple searches and digging through links to find quality sources and the right information for you. Now, chat can get you to a better answer.” Google’s pitch is that its AI “will do the Googling for you.” Perplexity’s chief business officer told me this summer that “people don’t come to Perplexity to consume journalism,” and that the AI tool will provide less traffic than traditional search. For curious users, Perplexity suggests follow-up questions so that, instead of opening a footnote, you keep reading in Perplexity.

The change will be the equivalent of going from navigating a library with the Dewey decimal system, and thus encountering related books on adjacent shelves, to requesting books for pickup through a digital catalog. It could completely reorient our relationship to knowledge, prioritizing rapid, detailed, abridged answers over a deep understanding and the consideration of varied sources and viewpoints. Much of what’s beautiful about searching the internet is jumping into ridiculous Reddit debates and developing unforeseen obsessions on the way to mastering a topic you’d first heard of six hours ago, via a different search; falling into clutter and treasure, all the time, without ever intending to. AI search may close off these avenues to not only discovery but its impetus, curiosity.

The issues with factuality and attribution may well be resolved—but even if they aren’t, tech companies show no signs of relenting. Controlling search means controlling how most people access every other digital thing—it’s an incredible platform to gain trust and visibility, advertise, or influence public opinion.

The internet is changing, and nobody outside these corporations has any say in it. And the biggest, most useful, and most frightening change may come from AI search engines working flawlessly. With AI, the goal is to keep you in one tech company’s ecosystem—to keep you using the AI interface, and getting the information that the AI deems relevant and necessary. The best searches are goal-oriented; the best responses are brief. Which perhaps shouldn’t be surprising coming from Silicon Valley behemoths that care, above all, about optimizing their businesses, products, and users’ lives.

A little, or even a lot, of inefficiency in search has long been the norm; AI will snuff it out. Our lives will be more convenient and streamlined, but perhaps a bit less wonderful and wonder-filled, a bit less illuminated. A process once geared toward exploration will shift to extraction. Less meandering, more hunting. No more unknown unknowns. If these companies really have their way, no more hyperlinks—and thus, no actual web.",https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/ai-search-engines-curiosity/680594/

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip maker, told Chinese customers it would no longer manufacture AI chips at advanced process nodes of 7 nanometres or smaller, FT said on Friday.

The U.S. has imposed a raft of measures aimed at restricting the shipment of advanced GPU chips – which enable AI – to China to hobble its artificial intelligence capabilities, which Washington fears could be used to develop bioweapons and launch large-scale cyberattacks.

Earlier this month, the U.S. imposed a $500,000 penalty on New York-based GlobalFoundries for shipping chips without authorization to an affiliate of blacklisted Chinese chip maker SMIC.

Any future supplies of the advanced AI chips by TSMC to Chinese customers would be subject to an approval process likely to involve Washington, according to the FT report.

“TSMC does not comment on market rumour. TSMC is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” the company said.

The U.S. Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The move to restrict exports to China comes at a time when the U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating how a chip produced by the Taiwanese chip maker ended up in a product made by China’s heavily sanctioned Huawei.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-tsmc-to-reportedly-suspend-production-of-advanced-ai-chips-for-china/

Intel INTC-Q shares climbed more than 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates and beat expectations for the third quarter.

Intel reported a massive net loss on Thursday, weighed down by impairment and restructuring charges.

The company has largely missed out on a boom in investments in speedy, advanced AI chips for data centres as businesses double down on adopting generative AI technology – a market dominated by Nvidia, followed by rival AMD.

In an interview with Reuters, Intel finance chief David Zinsner said the company was “making progress” on its profitability but that it had “a lot of work to do” to achieve the targets it has set.

Intel reported a net loss of $16.6 billion for the third quarter, excluding losses attributable to certain noncontrolling interests. That compares with a net profit attributable to Intel of about $300 million in the year-ago period.

As one of the largest makers of PC chips, Intel has benefited as the rollout of on-device AI features and a fresh Windows update cycle have renewed demand for PCs after a years-long slump, helping the company surpass Wall Street’s low expectations.

Revenue in Intel’s Client Computing Group – which includes its PC chips for desktop and laptop computers – fell 7% to $7.3 billion. Analysts estimated the client segment would shrink to $7.38 billion.

The company expects revenue to be between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion for the current quarter, the midpoint of which is above analysts’ average estimate of $13.66 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.

Analysts also expect demand for traditional server chips made by Intel – its mainstay data-center semiconductors – to pick up in the second half of the year after several quarters of soft demand as investment is funnelled to AI chips.

For the data centre segment, which includes AI chips, Intel reported revenue grew 9% to $3.3 billion, which beat analyst estimates of $3.16 billion.

However, Intel’s share of the PC and server CPU market is consistently threatened by AMD, which now boasts a market valuation larger than that of Intel and is also the closest competitor to market leader Nvidia in AI graphics processors.

Finance chief Zinsner also told Reuters the company planned $12 billion to $14 billion in capital spending in 2025.

Revenue in the company’s contract manufacturing business, or foundry, shrank to $4.4 billion. Intel reported an adjusted gross margin of 18%, compared with analyst estimates of 37.9%

“Let’s be honest, expectations were quite low for the company and they beat those lowered expectations” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist of Carson Group. “Both products and foundry did well and the quarter overall was a nice job by the struggling company.”",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-intel-reports-third-quarter-loss-but-forecasts-q4-revenue-above/

Wiles has been widely lauded for heading Trump’s successful campaign this year, having run Trump’s campaign operations in Florida in 2016 and 2020. She maintained close ties with the president-elect throughout the Biden administration and signed on as CEO of Trump’s Save America PAC in 2021.

""Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is Trump's pick for the position of director of national intelligence. The announcement was made on Wednesday.

The cabinet-level position involves overseeing the intelligence community and advising Trump and the National Security Council on intelligence matters. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and a U.S. Army reservist.

""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

President-elect Donald Trump nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State.

""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rubio is known as an Iran and China hawk. He is a top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and ran for president in 2016.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

If confirmed, Gaetz will oversee the Department of Justice after Trump's inauguration in January.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and quickly endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket, and has since repeatedly vowed to ""Make America Healthy Again.""

President-elect Trump announced Thursday that he is nominating Jay Clayton to serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Jay Clayton, of New York, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during my first term, where he did an incredible job, is hereby nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.

""Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,"" the president-elect added.

President-elect Trump announced on Thursday his intent to nominate former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to serve as secretary of veterans affairs.

""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.

""Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role,"" the president-elect added.

Trump announced Dean John Sauer as his pick for U.S. solicitor general.

""John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,"" Trump said in the announcement.

Sauer served as solicitor general of Missouri from 2017 to 2023, and represented Trump in his successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States.

President-elect Trump announced that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will lead the Department of the Interior during a speech at the Americans for Prosperity Gala at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's going to be announced [Friday]…I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now, actually,"" Trump said. ""He's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's going to be fantastic.""

Burgum, a multi-millionaire former software company CEO turned two-term governor, launched a White House bid in June 2023. The governor made energy and natural resources a key part of his campaign for the GOP nomination.

After he dropped out of the race, Burgum became a high profile surrogate for the former president, appearing on the campaign trail and in media hits on Trump’s behalf.

3c27986e-016b-4843-bb5c-5d632c3a4b3a,2024-11-14,Politics,Tulsi Gabbard’s Nomination Is a National-Security Risk,"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated former Representative Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after 9/11 to remedy what American policy makers believed was a lack of coordination among the various national-intelligence agencies, and the DNI sits atop all of America’s intelligence services, including the CIA.

Gabbard is stunningly unqualified for almost any Cabinet post (as are some of Trump’s other picks), but especially for ODNI. She has no qualifications as an intelligence professional—literally none. (She is a reserve lieutenant colonel who previously served in the Hawaii Army National Guard, with assignments in medical, police, and civil-affairs-support positions.

President-elect Donald Trump has named Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. A longtime Trump ally, Stefanik is a staunch supporter of Israel and has also been critical of the UN for what she argues is a lack of sufficient backing for its war against Hamas. “Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,” Trump said in a statement confirming the first cabinet pick of his second term. If confirmed, Stefanik would replace UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat who worked for the US Foreign Service for 35 years.

Stefanik said she was ""deeply humbled"" to accept Trump's nomination and was looking forward to ""earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate"", which must vote on her nomination to make it official. “America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,"" Stefanik added in a statement given to the New York Post. The New York Congresswoman has minimal experience in foreign policy and national security. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Since Hamas's 7 October attack, she has become one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel in Congress, garnering national attention as she led congressional hearings about university presidents' handling of protests on college campuses.

President-elect Donald Trump says that Tom Homan, his former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as “border czar” in his incoming administration.

“I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders,” he wrote late Sunday on his Truth Social site.

Homan was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border and Trump’s pledge to launch the largest deportation operation in the country’s history.

In addition to overseeing the southern and northern borders and “maritime, and aviation security,” Trump said Homan “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,” a central part of his agenda.

He says he had “no doubt” Homan “will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.”

In an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Homan said the military would not be rounding up and arresting immigrants in the country illegally and that ICE would move to implement Trump’s plans in a “humane manner.”

“It’s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They’re good at it,” he said. “When we go out there, we’re going to know who we’re looking for. We most likely know where they’re going to be, and it’s going to be done in a humane manner.”

Earlier this year at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Homan expressed frustration at the news coverage of a mass deportation operation.

“Wait until 2025,” he said, adding that, while he thinks the government needed to prioritize national security threats, “no one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”

1731361258,2024-11-11,Politics,Trump expected to announce Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy,"CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.

Miller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump and was his lead speechwriter during his first administration, has been a leading advocate for a more restrictive immigration policy and is expected to take on an expanded role in the president-elect’s second term. He’s been closely involved in Trump’s transition process and will have a key role in future staffing decisions. During the campaign, he frequently traveled to rallies with Trump on his private plane and was increasingly visible as a speaker at events in recent months.

Miller is also a lead architect of the president-elect’s plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. He has said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the number of deportations to more than 1 million per year. In an interview on Fox News last week, Miller expressed eagerness at the prospect of beginning mass deportations as soon as possible.

“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.

Asked about the expected announcement, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN, “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.”

A longtime hardliner on immigration, Miller was instrumental in setting up immigration restrictions during the first Trump administration, advocating for child separation in migrant detention facilities and a travel ban targeting people from majority-Muslim countries.

After Trump left office, Miller started an advisory group called America First Legal, which went on to contribute to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president created by the Heritage Foundation. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025, claiming that he had no idea who was behind it, despite its close ties to Miller and other crucial figures in Trump’s orbit.

In an interview with The New York Times last year, Miller said that under a second Trump term, the military would build detention centers to house immigrants who have been arrested and are facing deportation. The new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border,” he told The Times.

Miller told The Times that Trump’s immigration plans are being designed to avoid having to create new substantial legislation. During Trump’s first term, he relied heavily on executive orders to implement immigration policy. Many of those moves were challenged in the courts, something Miller acknowledged would likely happen again in a second Trump term.

In his comments last year, Miller was up-front about his belief that Trump would not hesitate to implement harsh immigration measures in a second term.

“Any activists who doubt President Trump’s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,” Miller said at the time.

4ef6e71e-674d-4f3b-aab5-090e06705aac,2024-11-08,Politics,Conservatives tried to repeal one of the country’s strongest climate policies. They failed big time.,"This story was originally published by Grist and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters, 62 percent, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.

On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.

“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”

Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.

Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as politically risky. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.

The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”

Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among a network of states in the East, but Washington’s law is more ambitious, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.

“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguy?n, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts.

The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.

Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising $16 million. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.

The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite appeals to the state Supreme Court by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to $5, the highest in the country, in 2023 — have now come down to around $4 a gallon.

Another ballot initiative, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy.

Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.

The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguy?n said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”",https://www.vox.com/climate/383706/climate-washington-cap-trade-carbon-tax-repeal-election-2024

Putin and Trump pictured together at a summit in Vietnam in 2017

A Kremlin spokesperson said the reports were ""pure fiction"", while Trump's team told the BBC that it would not comment on the president-elect's ""private calls"".

Trump is also reported to have mentioned America's extensive military presence in Europe to Putin.

The call, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday, is said to have happened on Thursday.

The Kremlin has denied media reports that US President-elect Donald Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, in which he is said to have warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.

Trump's communications director Steven Cheung told the BBC: ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.""

But he said leaders had begun the process of contacting the president-elect.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied a conversation had taken place.

""This is completely untrue, it is pure fiction. That is, this is simply false information. There was no conversation,"" Peskov said.

Trump has promised to end the nearly three-year long war in Ukraine, but has yet to outline how he intends to do so.

Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war.

While Peskov on Sunday spoke to Russian state media of ""positive"" signals from the incoming US administration, others say they trust the future president will not abandon Ukraine.

They include John Healey, the British defence secretary, who said he expected the US ""to remain alongside allies like the UK, standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes to prevail over Putin's invasion"".

On Sunday, during a visit to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that any end to the war needed to be sustainable.

""This is a warning for the ones who say, this war has to end, so let's finish it as soon as possible no matter how. How matters,"" he said.

In Washington, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said outgoing president Joe Biden would make the case to Trump that walking away from Ukraine would mean greater instability in Europe.

On Monday, Germany's Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned that Putin could take advantage of the US post-election transition period to press Moscow's advantage in Ukraine.

Urging Berlin and fellow European Union member states to increase aid to Kyiv, she said: ""We don't have time to wait until spring. Now is the transition phase that Putin has been waiting for and aiming for.""

A dam close to the front line in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region was damaged on Monday, according to regional head Vadym Filashkin.

Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff approached their row of seats from the first lady’s right as the vice president greeted and shook hands with those around her — except Biden.

""It’s safe to say that Jill Biden hates Kamala Harris’ guts,"" conservative commentator Steve Cortes said while sharing a video snippet of the non-interaction.

As Harris took her seat, Biden appeared to look straight ahead through dark sunglasses.

""Jill Biden refused to even look at Kamala,"" claimed the popular X account ""End Wokeness.""

Journalist Andy Ngo shared a closer-up shot of the second family and first lady, describing Biden as ""stone face[d]"" and commenting that Harris supporters have been, in part, blaming President Biden for their candidate’s loss last Tuesday.

The interaction, or lack thereof, also received international media attention as Italian TV journalist Leonardo Panetta wrote on X in Italian that Harris was ""ignored"" by Biden after her defeat.

""Jill Biden… did not get up to greet her and then remained seated next to the vice president wearing sunglasses without deigning to look at her,"" Panetta said. ""Good climate in America.""

""They’re not taking the loss well,"" remarked right-wing commentator Benny Arthur Johnson.

""Watch Jill Biden evidently give Kamala the cold shoulder as she arrives at Arlington National Cemetery. Kamala shook everyone’s hand before swiftly racing past Jill as the cameras were rolling.""

Fellow commentator Dave Rubin added in a separate post that he hasn’t ""seen two chicks that hated each other that much since Dorothy stole all the men at the Rusty Anchor from Blanche in season 7 of ‘The Golden Girls’.""

""Whoever seated them together hates them both,"" one user replied to Rubin.

Conservative author David Harris Jr. suggested there appears to be a ""rift"" within the party following Harris’ blowout loss to President-elect Donald Trump.

The first lady reportedly did greet Emhoff ""enthusiastically,"" according to a recounting by the Daily Mail, but she appeared more stoic when Harris arrived.

During the campaign, the first lady did campaign for Harris and spoke of how they bonded over the loss of close family members to cancer and other connections.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz faces a new era of divided government when he returns home from the presidential campaign trail, now that Republicans appear to have broken the Democratic trifecta that helped put him on Kamala Harris’ radar.

While Democrats will keep their one-seat majority in the Senate, leaders on both sides agree that Republicans gained enough seats in the election to tie control of the House at 67-67.

According to a tally by The Associated Press, the chamber stood at 65-65 Wednesday afternoon. It would end in a 67-67 tie if the leaders of the last four undeclared races remain ahead. Two of them are so razor-thin that automatic recounts have been triggered unless lawmakers waive them.

The last time the House was tied was in 1979, and the history of that legislative session suggests that power-sharing will be contentious.

In House District 14B, in the St. Cloud area, Democratic incumbent Dan Wolgamott led by just 28 votes over Republican Sue Ek in unofficial results as of midday Wednesday, while in District 54A, in the Shakopee area, incumbent Democrat Brad Tabke led Republican Aaron Paul by just 13 votes. Two other races had margins of 225 votes and 160 votes with 99% of the votes counted.

Recounts in legislative races rarely change outcomes, according to Minnesota’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Library. Fluctuations in the vote totals, if any, usually stay within single digits. The prominent exception in recent decades was in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate race in 2008, when Democrat Al Franken came from behind to unseat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes after an eight-month recount and court battle.

While Democratic legislative leaders warned ahead of the 2024 election that split control would be a recipe for gridlock, both sides tried to sound optimistic notes at news conferences Wednesday afternoon. They said they’ve hardly begun to discuss what their power-sharing agreement might look like as they contemplate their main task of the 2025 session, passing a balanced budget. Among the questions is who will be speaker of the House.

The current minority leader, Republican Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said the tie will mean “balance” after two years of full Democratic control.

“This is the opportunity for us to work together with our colleagues, the Democrats across the aisle, and find ways to best serve Minnesotans,” Demuth told reporters.

The current speaker, Democrat Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, acknowledged that she’d like to keep the job but agreed that everything will have to be negotiated.

“There will be an opportunity for us to show Minnesotans some good bipartisan working together and getting things done,” Hortman told reporters. ”Minnesotans certainly sent us a tied Minnesota House. What they are asking us to do is to work together and be productive.”

Hortman said she and Demuth already have “a great friendship and working relationship to build on.” She also noted that she worked well with Senate Republicans when that body was under GOP control. Power-sharing works when lawmakers treat each other with respect and “fundamental decency” and keep their word, she said.

Minnesota has usually had some degree of divided government over the last several decades. The 2019 session — the first under Walz — wasn’t always pretty, but both sides agreed it was fairly productive despite Republicans holding the Senate and Democrats controlling the House.

Democrats gained their trifecta — control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers — in the 2022 election and used it to enact a long list of pent-up priorities last year. Those included stronger protections for abortion rights and trans rights, child tax credits, paid family and medical leave, free school meals for all kids and gun safety measures, to name just a few.

Democrats also held full power under Gov. Mark Dayton in the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions and in the four sessions from 1987-1990 under Gov. Rudy Perpich. But Minnesota Republicans haven’t had a trifecta since the late 1960s under Gov. Harold LeVander, when legislative races were technically nonpartisan and lawmakers caucused as either conservatives or liberals.

In 1979, GOP and Democratic leaders came up with a power-sharing agreement after weeks of difficult negotiations that gave Republicans the speakership, while Democrats got the chairmanships of the three most powerful committees. The arrangement worked fairly smoothly for most of the session. Bills that advanced through the process generally had bipartisan support. But the deal fell apart in the closing days, and lawmakers needed a one-day special session to finish off the year’s must-pass bills.

Hortman said the approach leaders tried in 1979 seems “a bit archaic,” and that they’ll study how shared power has worked in other legislatures in hopes of finding a better model.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tim-walz-minnesota-post-election_n_672c9677e4b0933e82c9054d

Top Senate Republicans are withholding support for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, while Democrats and at least one prominent GOP senator call for the release of an ethics report into the former congressman.

Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he “absolutely” wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s findings on Gaetz. “I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,” he said.

A long-awaited report from the ethics panel was expected to be released as soon as Friday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. But Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced his intent to nominate the Florida Republican to be attorney general and it is now uncertain if the information will ever be made public. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Ad Feedback

Republicans on the ethics panel canceled a scheduled Friday meeting with Democrats that was expected to address the long-awaited report, according to two sources familiar. The Republican members huddled privately Thursday night but declined to comment to reporters as they left.

The Gaetz nomination could set up a major clash between Trump and the new Senate GOP majority as the president-elect has vowed to get his nominees installed.

Ad Feedback

Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, will face an early test over the controversial nomination and can only afford three defections if Republicans end up with 53 seats.

Trump has pushed to keep all options on the table to greenlight his nominees, including recess appointments, which would bypass the typical Senate confirmation process.

But several GOP senators have expressed reservations over that prospect, creating another potential point of contention with the president-elect.

Sen. James Lankford, a newly elected member of GOP leadership, argued that the use of recess appointments “shows the Senate is not doing their work.”

“That’s a totally different issue. I think the Supreme Court would even step in on those roles,” he said. “The Supreme Court has already spoken to the time period it would take. Quite frankly the Senate should be here, do its work. A recess has to be more than two weeks already, and that would say that Congress is not here already doing its tasks. So we need to be able to be here and do its tasks.”

“I don’t think we should be circumventing the Senate’s responsibilities,” Cornyn told CNN. “But I think it’s premature to be talking about recess appointments right now.” Previously, when he was running for GOP leader, Cornyn had indicated that he was open to using recess appointments to bypass Democratic opposition to Trump’s nominees.

However, Sen. Rick Scott told CNN, “I believe in recess appointments.” Scott had supported recess appointments during his bid for GOP leader, which he lost to Thune.

Scott also indicated his support for Trump’s intended nomination of Gaetz, saying, “I think he’ll do a good job.”

Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, as well as other top Senate Democrats on the committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Chris Coons, called on the ethics panel to release its findings and raised concerns over Gaetz’s move to resign before the report came out. The ethics panel only has jurisdiction over a member when they are serving in Congress.

Durbin told CNN, “The timing of the resignation and flight with President-elect Donald Trump suggests that he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable, so I want to read the report and find out what the investigation behind it brought out.”

Blumenthal said, “Matt Gaetz has chosen to resign from the House, but he can’t choose to conceal that information.”

Coons added that Trump “is entitled to his nominations, but he’s not entitled to a confirmation of any, literally any, nominee.”

Asked if the Senate should get the House ethics report on Gaetz, Thune said, “I haven’t given that any thought yet. I just know that the nomination isn’t formalized yet, but when it is, we’ll process it in the way we typically do and provide our advise and consent.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is set to reclaim the chair of the committee in charge of vetting Trump’s judicial nominees, would not say if he’d ask for the House Ethics report in the vetting process his committee will do.

“We’ve got a professional staff on Judiciary that will do a full job of vetting and all those questions (about Gaetz) will be answered by the vetting process,” Grassley said.

Top Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis, were careful to keep their options open on the nomination.

Tillis said it is “up to” the ethics committee, and Graham said, “I don’t know what the rules are.” Sen. Josh Hawley added, “That’s really a matter for the House.”

Graham said that he has “voted for a lot of people I didn’t like,” and said, “The process I will follow here is what I’ve done with everybody. Elections have consequences, he chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee, and he will be asked hard questions, and we’ll see.”

Tillis said, “I barely know Gaetz. All I know is he likes to pick fights on social media. You’ll have to deal with that in committees. But I don’t know his background.”

Pressed on whether he would support Gaetz’s nomination, Tillis said, “I expect us to treat every nominee coming from an administration, whether they’re Democrat or Republican, with respect, but at the end of the day, you got to have the votes and you better have the resume. That’s how this process works.”

And Cornyn did not rule out backing Gaetz. “We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees, and that’s where all the questions that you have and that we have will be considered under oath,” he told reporters. “So that’s a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the judiciary committee.”

Controversy over recess appointments

There is very little that Democrats can do if Republicans insist on moving forward with recess appointments. If the two houses of Congress want to put the Senate into a recess long enough for the recess appointment window to open, it just takes a concurrent adjournment resolution of the two chambers.

That can pass with a simple majority in the House and the Senate. And Republicans will have a majority in both.

That doesn’t mean Democrats wouldn’t, or couldn’t, try to fight it. These adjournment resolutions are not debatable but they are amendable so Democrats could try and delay this with a vote-a-rama-style amendment process, but those last only hours, not long enough to block a cabinet pick forever.

The Supreme Court has ruled on questions about recess appointments, which makes the outcome of taking these questions to court uncertain. But, multiple sources warned CNN that it’s too soon to know how Democrats would proceed if Thune really did move ahead with this tactic.

Ultimately, Democrats’ best defense against recess appointments may be Republicans senators themselves. The Senate would have to pass an adjournment resolution with a simple majority and that means, again, Thune couldn’t lose more than a handful of his GOP members.

The key question then would be whether some Republicans would be willing to stand in the way of the executive branch circumventing their advise and consent role.
