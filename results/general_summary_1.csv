The victim was able to get away, and two bystanders in a grey or white vehicle helped her, York police said. York Regional Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was sexually assaulted in Vaughan on Friday, Nov. 8. Around 7 a.m., police said, the victim was waiting for a bus near Countryside Road and Bramalea Road when the suspect approached her in a black sedan, presented himself as a rideshare driver and offered her a ride. The suspect then drove the victim to the area of Highway 27 and Nashville Road in Vaughan where he sexually assaulted her, police said in a news release. The victim was able to get away, and two bystanders in a grey or white vehicle helped her. Investigators say the suspect then fled the area. The suspect is described as a man who was about five-feet-six inches tall and between 23 and 25 years of age, who had black hair, black eyes, a thin build, and a full beard approximately two inches in length. Previously, Peel police had disclosed a similar crime on the same day, saying that in Brampton around 7 a.m. Friday, an 18-year-old woman was assaulted by a man presenting himself as a rideshare driver. York Regional Police are reminding people who use ridesharing services to always verify vehicles, licence plates and drives. Anyone with information on the Vaughan incident, including bystanders, is asked to call the York Regional Police Special Victims Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071, or contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS, or leave an anonymous tip online at www.1800222tips.com.

In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft zoomed past Uranus as part of a grand tour of the outer solar system. That flyby, lasting just five hours, remains to date the only visit to Uranus by a spacecraft from Earth, with much of our understanding of the planet coming from that brief encounter.

Peculiarly, as Voyager 2 soared about 50,000 miles above the planet, it found that Uranus was quite different from other worlds in the outer solar system. In particular, its protective magnetic field, known as a magnetosphere, was devoid of plasma, something prevalent around other planets.

“We observed this empty magnetosphere,” said Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And its radiation belts, regions of the planet’s magnetic field that trap high-energy particles, were surprisingly intense, something that “breaks current radiation belt theory,” Dr. Jasinski said.

Now we may know why. In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, Dr. Jasinski and his colleagues suggest that Voyager 2’s visit flyby occurred during an exceptional increase in solar activity, which caused shrinking of the planet’s magnetosphere. That created conditions at Uranus that occurred just four percent of the time in the data that the team analyzed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/science/uranus-voyager-2-flyby.html,"A recent study suggests that our understanding of Uranus's magnetosphere might have been skewed due to Voyager 2 encountering the planet during a rare solar event that compresses its magnetosphere. This peculiar event, occurring only 4% of the time, left the magnetosphere devoid of plasma and contributed to unexpectedly intense radiation belts, challenging existing theories. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy, help explain discrepancies in data collected during Voyager 2’s flyby in 1986, indicating the need to reassess our knowledge of Uranus's space environment.","In January 1986, Voyager 2 conducted a five-hour flyby of Uranus, which significantly expanded our understanding of the planet and its unique magnetic environment. This NASA mission, part of a broader exploration of the outer solar system, revealed that Uranus's magnetosphere was notably devoid of plasma and contained unexpectedly intense radiation belts, challenging existing theories. Recent studies suggest Voyager 2 witnessed an unusual solar event that temporarily altered these conditions, highlighting the importance of such findings in shaping our understanding of planetary dynamics, akin to how new political data can redefine perspectives or inform policy decisions.","In January 1986, Voyager 2 conducted a five-hour flyby of Uranus, which significantly expanded our understanding of the planet and its unique magnetic environment.

The U.S. government’s highway safety agency is investigating complaints that engines can fail on as many as 1.4 million Honda and Acura vehicles.

The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers the 2016 through 2020 Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, as well as the 2018 through 2020 Honda Odyssey and Acura TLX. Also included is the 2017 through 2019 Honda Ridgeline.

The agency says in documents posted on its website Monday that connecting rod bearings on vehicles with 3.5-liter V6 engines can fail, leading to complete engine failure. Connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft and convert vertical motion to move the wheels.

Ad Feedback

Honda recalled about 250,000 vehicles in November of 2023 to fix the same problem. But the agency says it has 173 complaints from owners who reported connecting rod bearing failures, yet their vehicles weren’t included in the recall. One owner reported a crash with no injuries.

The agency said it’s opening a recall query to determine the severity of the problem in vehicles not included in the 2023 recall.

Ad Feedback

Honda said it will cooperate with NHTSA on the investigation.

In documents explaining the 2023 recall, the automaker said had 1,450 warranty claims due to the bearing problem but no reports of injuries.

A sign reading “closed” is shown next to the entrance to a terminal at the Port of Montreal in Montreal, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, where a lock out of dock workers has been declared by the employer.  MONTREAL - Operations at the Port of Montreal were greatly reduced Monday as the Maritime Employers Association made good on a threat to lock out nearly 1,200 longshore workers if they didn’t accept what it called a final contract offer. The lockout took effect at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and the employers’ association is asking federal Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon to intervene. MacKinnon’s office issued a statement Monday calling on both sides at the country’s second largest port to get back to the negotiating table. “The parties must understand the urgency of the situation and do the work necessary to reach an agreement,” his office said. “Canadians are counting on them.” The union told a news conference on Monday it is ready to return to the table as early as Tuesday. But Michel Murray, an adviser with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents the dock workers, said union overtures have received no response from the employer. Murray told a news conference simultaneous lockouts in Montreal and Vancouver seem designed to force the federal government’s hand. Port workers in British Columbia are locked out amid a labour dispute involving more than 700 longshore supervisors, resulting in a paralysis of container cargo traffic at terminals across Canada’s west coast. “We hope that the employer side will emerge from its silence of the past three weeks,” Murray said. “But clearly, when we look at what is happening, the lockout in Vancouver, the lockout in Montreal, we feel that it is a co-ordinated, planned attempt to increase the pressure on the federal government so that it intervenes in our file.” Julie Gascon, CEO of the Montreal Port Authority, warned of “catastrophic” economic consequences of a prolonged conflict. “This lockout affects not only the 1,200 longshoremen directly impacted by the work stoppage, but it also impacts over 10,000 workers in the logistics sector, from trucking and railway employees to maritime agents and pilots,” she said in a statement. “Logistics jobs are the first to be affected, which inevitably sets off a domino effect throughout the entire economy in the markets we serve.” Gascon told reporters in an early morning news conference effects will trickle down to other parts of the economy. “Today the conflict is impacting the supply chain, but tomorrow the conflict will impact factories as well, after that, it will be retailers,” she said. The Port of Montreal, which moves nearly $400 million in goods every day, said essential services will continue, with liquid bulk terminals and the grain terminal among those remaining open. The employers association in Montreal said it initiated the lockout after the unionized workers voted almost unanimously to reject a contract offer tabled last week. The workers have been without a collective agreement since Dec. 31 and had rejected two previous offers. The employer said last week its latest offer included a three-per-cent salary increase each year for four years and a 3.5 per cent increase for the two subsequent years. The employer said the increases offered would bring a longshore worker’s total average compensation to more than $200,000 per year at the end of the six-year contract. The union, the Syndicat des débardeurs du port de Montréal, called the figure exaggerated. It said the employer is focused on salaries, but what members want are improvements in scheduling and work-life balance. Members who are parents do not want to have stretches where they work 19 out of 21 days, it said. Murray said it’s time to put those previous offers — which clearly cannot be the basis of any agreement — in the “shredder” and discuss what it will take for both sides to enter into a long-term agreement. The Conseil du patronat, which represents Quebec employers, said it is very concerned about the latest work stoppage. It and a group representing manufacturers called on the federal government to intervene. “Businesses and citizens can no longer bear the cost of this situation, which is repeated too often,” the Conseil du patronat said in a statement.

However, not until you are taught a lesson in past racism, land settlement and slavery.

Even on Remembrance Day at Toronto’s Cenotaph honouring the war fallen who gave Canada its freedoms, the event couldn’t begin without a reminder of what could perhaps be the reason you don’t see many people wearing poppies in 2024.

It took a while to get around to the sacrifice of Canadian troops. There were other matters to attend to first. Namely Canadians are “settlers” who engaged in “slavery” and “discrimination.”

Article content As it said in the program, “MC Aretha Phillip, chief of protocol for the City of Toronto, brings remarks including the territorial land acknowledgment.” It lasted three minutes. “I would like to begin by acknowledging the Indigenous people of these lands,” Phillip said. “It’s important that we reaffirm our commitment and responsibility to improving relations between nations and learning about the rich history of this land to better understand our role as residents, neighbours, partners and caretakers in this place we each call home.”

Article content “The City of Toronto acknowledges the land we are meeting on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. We also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit. We also acknowledge the Williams treaties, signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands. “The City of Toronto also acknowledges all treaty peoples including those who came here as settlers, as migrants either in this generation or generations past including those of us who came here involuntarily, particularly those brought to these lands as a result of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. We pay tribute to ancestors of African origin and descent. In keeping with this tribute during this remembrance week, the city commemorated the contribution of No. 2 Construction Battalion, Canada’s only all-Black battalion. Despite facing discrimination, these brave men took up the call to serve during the First World War more than 100 years ago and we are joined today by their descendants.”

d1d961e1-3b79-44c6-b3f2-74ecdabd4bcb,2024-11-12,General,Blue state Democrats issue scathing reflection on election loss: 'We're out of touch',"Two blue state Democrats in Congress issued blistering assessments of where their party stands after Tuesday night’s overwhelming election defeat and offered suggestions about changes that Democrats need to make.

""That was a cataclysm,"" Connecticut Sen. Chis Murphy posted on X . ""Electoral map wipeout. Senate D practical ceiling is now 52 seats. R's is 62.""

""Time to rebuild the left,"" Murphy wrote. ""We are out of touch with the crisis of meaning/purpose fueling MAGA. We refuse to pick big fights. Our tent is too small.""

In a lengthy X thread that had more than 7 million views on Monday morning, Murphy said Democrats ""don't listen enough; we tell people what's good for them"" and skip ""past the way people are feeling (alone, impotent, overwhelmed) and straight to uninspiring solutions (more roads! bulk drug purchasing!) that do little to actually upset the status quo of who has power and who doesn't.""

HARRIS PAID OPRAH $1 MILLION IN FAILED BID TO HELP CAMPAIGN: REPORT

Murphy acknowledged a disconnect between everyday working class voters and the ""elites"" and suggested the party needs to more openly embrace candidates who reject the status quo.

""And when progressives like Bernie aggressively go after the elites that hold people down, they are shunned as dangerous populists,"" Murphy wrote. ""Why? Maybe because true economic populism is bad for our high-income base.""

""We cannot be afraid of fights – especially with the economic elites who have profited off neoliberalism. The right regularly picks fights with elites – Hollywood, higher ed, etc. Democrats (e.g. the Harris campaign) are tepid in our fights with billionaires and corporations.""

MARK CUBAN, MAVERICKS MINORITY OWNER AND HARRIS SURROGATE, TAKES HEAT FOR DELETING SUPPORTIVE POSTS OF VP

Murphy told his followers that ""real economic populism should be our tentpole.""

""Those are hard things for the left,"" Murphy wrote in the final post of the thread. ""A firm break with neoliberalism. Listen to poor and rural people, men in crisis. Don't decide for them. Pick fights. Embrace populism. Build a big tent. Be less judgmental. But we are beyond small fixes.""

New York Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan, who won re-election in New York’s 18th Congressional District despite the red wave that swept across most of the country, also put forward a post-mortem on social media that was seen by millions of users.

""First and foremost, if you're using the words ‘moderate’ or ‘progressive’ you're missing the whole f***ing point,"" Ryan wrote on X . ""It's not ideological. It's about who fights for the people vs. who further empowers and enables the elites.""

Ryan explained his take on why he was able to win as a Democrat in a pro-Republican climate and said he ""put affordability front and center every day.""

""Most importantly, I told folks exactly who it was that was ripping them off, and I grounded it locally. It's the billionaires and big corporations making record-breaking profits while the rest of us struggle.""

Ryan wrote, ""It's not enough to throw these seemingly disparate policies at people. We must articulate a unifying principle, and clearly tell folks who’s at fault. For me, it was Freedom. and Patriotism. And the fault lies with the same elites, in both parties, who've run this country for far too long.""

Various camps within the Democratic Party have been pointing fingers at each other Democrat presidential candidate Vice President Harris' loss to President-elect Donald Trump last week.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pinned blame for the loss on the Democratic Party for ""abandoning"" the working class, sparking a rebuke from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

""It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,"" Sanders posted to X last week, accompanied by a press release on the election results. ""And they’re right.""

Pelosi responded that the party has not left the working class behind in favor of kowtowing to ""big-money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party,"" as Sanders had argued in his press release.

""With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families. That's where we are,"" Pelosi told the New York Times' ""The Interview"" podcast on Saturday.



Fox News Digital's Emma Colton contributed to this report.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-democrats-issue-scathing-reflection-on-election-loss-were-out-of-touch,"In the wake of significant election losses, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy and New York Representative Pat Ryan have called for the Democratic Party to reconnect with working-class Americans by embracing economic populism and actively challenging elite power structures. Both politicians criticized the party's cautious approach to populism and underscored a need to address the crises facing everyday voters, suggesting the party's focus has been too narrow and disconnected from the electorate's concerns. Meanwhile, a debate has emerged within the party, with figures like Bernie Sanders highlighting the alleged neglect of the working class, while former Speaker Nancy Pelosi disputes such claims, maintaining that the party remains committed to representing working-class interests.","Following a recent electoral defeat, Democratic politicians including Sen. Chris Murphy and Rep. Pat Ryan are urging the party to refocus on populist strategies by challenging economic elites and engaging more with working-class and rural voters. Despite differing views within the party, as highlighted by figures like Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi, there is a consensus on the need for Democrats to articulate a clear, unified message against powerful corporate interests. These reflections may shape future Democratic strategies, potentially influenced by initiatives like Project 2025, which emphasize broadening party appeal and rebuilding connections with disenfranchised voters.","Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and New York Rep. Pat Ryan have criticized the Democratic Party for being out of touch with working-class voters, urging the party to adopt more populist and bold economic policies, especially in light of the recent election loss to President-elect Donald Trump. Both Murphy and Ryan emphasized the need to confront economic elites and bridge the gap between elites and everyday voters. In response to criticisms, including those from Sen. Bernie Sanders, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the Democratic Party's engagement with working-class families, countering claims that the party has forsaken them for wealthier interests."

Press freedom groups have a stark warning for Americans: Trump could pose a serious threat to fact-based journalism during his next term in office if he does not change course.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and Freedom of the Press Foundation all issued statements in the aftermath of Trump’s win this week, urging the ex- and soon-to-be president and his administration to commit to respecting the free press during the next four years. “Attacking the press is really an attack on American citizens’ right to know,” Reporters Without Borders Executive Director Clayton Weimers said in a statement. “Trump’s new administration can and must change its tune with the media and take concrete steps to protect journalists and develop a climate conducive to a robust and pluralistic news media.”

This will be a tall order for Trump: At a rally just last weekend, he said he would be OK with a crowd of journalists being shot at, as I reported at the time. His communications director, Steven Cheung, tried to clean up his comments by implausibly alleging that Trump “was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!” From early September until the end of October, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times, Reporters Without Borders found in an analysis published last month. Trump has repeatedly derided journalists as “fake news” and the media as “the enemy of the people.” And as my colleague Pema Levy reported, Trump also launched what experts said was a frivolous lawsuit against CBS News last month, alleging that producers unfairly edited a 60 Minutes interview with his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, to make her look better. His campaign also submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission claiming that the Washington Post was running a paid advertising campaign to boost stories critical of Trump; a Post spokesperson said the allegations were “improper” and “without merit.” CNN also reported that Trump has called at least 15 times for the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks he dislikes.

All this makes it no wonder, then, that Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s reelection “marks a dangerous moment for American journalism and global press freedom.” The Committee to Protect Journalists struck a similar tone. “Legal persecution, imprisonment, physical violence, and even killings have sadly become familiar threats for journalists across the world,” its statement said. “They must not now also become commonplace in the United States, where threats of violence and online harassment have in recent years become routine.” And Freedom of the Press Foundation claimed that Trump “will try to destroy press freedom”; as the group noted, Trump will have an ally in Elon Musk, who has spread pro-Trump disinformation on his platform to the tune of billions of views in the lead-up to Election Day. More recently, Musk has taken to telling everyday X users that they are the media now and “citizen journalism is the future.” (Apparently his conception of journalism sees conspiracy theories as acceptable and fact-checks as unnecessary.)

This all comes at a time when Republicans, and young people, are as likely to trust social media as a news source as they are to trust national news outlets, according to data published last month from Pew Research Center. The Trump campaign and the GOP have both contributed to and capitalized on this distrust, with Trump launching his own social media network, Truth Social, in 2022, and eschewing the cable news sit-downs Harris did during the campaign for interviews with right-wing male podcasters, who likely helped him make massive gains among young men this year. Media outlets hoping to win back the trust of these voters, though, will not just have podcasters and social media to compete with: One of their biggest adversaries will likely be Trump himself.

Spokespeople for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions from Mother Jones on Sunday.",https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/press-freedom-groups-trump-threat/,"Press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation, have raised concerns about former President Donald Trump posing a threat to fact-based journalism if he does not alter his stance toward the media in his next term. Trump's history of hostility toward the media, including verbal attacks, derogatory labels like ""fake news,"" and calling for the revocation of broadcasting licenses, has led these groups to view his reelection as a danger to press freedom in the U.S. and globally. Meanwhile, Trump's cultivation of distrust in traditional media outlets and promotion of alternative platforms like his Truth Social, amidst support from figures like Elon Musk, complicates efforts to restore journalistic credibility among certain demographic groups, notably young people and Republican voters.","Project 2025, a conservative initiative aiming to shape the future federal workforce and policies, involves influential think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation and seeks to implement significant changes aligned with conservative values. As Trump remains hostile to the press, with frequent attacks on media outlets and attempts to influence public opinion through platforms like Truth Social, his return to power signifies potential threats to press freedom and a continuation of misinformation strategies. This initiative and Trump's media relationship may significantly impact the US Election 2024 by altering public perceptions and trust in traditional news sources.","Press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation, have raised concerns about former President Donald Trump posing a threat to fact-based journalism if he does not alter his stance toward the media in his next term.

Nearly two years after the mobbing attack that left 59-year-old homeless man Kenneth Lee dead, the matter is still making its way through the courts. Toronto cops said Lee was swarmed and then stabbed to death near Union Station over defending a friend who was guarding her bottle of booze. Four of the youths have since pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the case: Three to manslaughter and one to assault causing bodily harm. Next year, the remaining quartet will stand trial. Three are dealing with second-degree murder charges and the outlier is charged with manslaughter. Each have all pleaded not guilty to their respective charges.

Article content Noted Toronto criminal lawyer Monte MacGregor — who has been involved in dozens of murder trials — told the Toronto Sun why he thinks the girls would opt for a judge. “You want a judge when you have a better case on the law, you want a jury when you have a better case on the facts,” MacGregor told the Sun. “It’s likely that the ones who opted for judge alone are not the stabber (the one that was directly responsible for causing the death). In law, you can be charged because you are the principal that caused the death or you can be considered a party to the offence by aiding or assisting in causing the death.” In the riddle of the Wayward Teen Girls, you opt for the judge, the lawyer said. “In this case, you would likely want a judge over a jury if you were not the stabber because you would argue that you … didn’t know that the stabber had a knife and was going to use it to cause the death,” MacGregor said.

Article content “A judge is supposed to look past the heinous nature of the offence and solely assess the case on the law without injecting emotion. A jury may convict someone far more easily by relying more on emotion and not adhering to the strict letter of the law.” And the murder of Ken Lee was very, very emotional, with one veteran detective telling me he thought the alleged killers were “animals.” According to cops, Lee was attacked by a rabid wolfpack of teen girls, high on booze and attitude, shortly after midnight on Dec. 18, 2022, in a parkette near University Ave. and Front St. after he came to the aid of a female friend who’d been robbed of her alcohol.

Article content Of course, the accused can’t be identified because of the trainwreck known as the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Keep in mind, Ken Lee was stabbed in the heart. His body had 19 different wounds from blunt-force trauma. And now, sometime in the new year, his family will once again be dragged through his horrifying final minutes on this earth. The accused? If convicted they will do a few months — if any time — in juvie, get a blast of street cred and move on. Possibly to more horrors. “The key in selecting a judge is that the defence will focus on the lack of overall contribution by the individual participant and will argue that the death was not foreseeable — essentially, they didn’t know the stabber was going to use the knife,” MacGregor explained. “Aiming for a not guilty or at its highest a manslaughter — not a murder conviction.” bhunter@postmedia.com @HunterTOSun

This choice is explained by lawyer Monte MacGregor, who suggests that a judge might focus more on legal nuances rather than emotions, potentially benefiting defendants who are not directly accused of stabbing but were involved in the incident. The article also highlights the emotional and societal impact of the crime and criticizes Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act for its handling of young offenders.","The accused teens in the Ken Lee murder case opted for a judge-alone trial to emphasize the legal technicalities over the emotional aspects of the case. Choosing a judge instead of a jury allows the defense to argue that the accused did not foresee the stabbing nor directly contribute to the death, aiming for reduced charges like manslaughter rather than murder. This case highlights broader societal issues such as youth violence and homelessness, reflecting ongoing challenges within the community.","The brutal murder of 59-year-old homeless man Kenneth Lee in Toronto involved a group of eight teenage girls, aged 13 to 16, who allegedly swarmed and stabbed him near Union Station.

NN: Rep. Cuellar (D-TX) on Homan: 'We can sit down and work together'

Tom Homan, President-elect Trump’s pick for “border czar” in his upcoming administration, pushed back against critics of his immigration ideology.

Fox Business’s Elizabeth MacDonald showed recent clips featuring MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace saying Homan has “ties to Project 2025,” former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro saying he has “a cowboy attitude” and that Trump’s deportation plan will “require a lot of pushback” and “The View” co-host Ana Navarro saying “when he says ‘Yes, families can be deported together,’ what he is saying, is that U.S. citizens can be deported.”

“Are you saying that, Tom?” MacDonald asked Homan on “The Evening Edit,” referring to Navarro’s statement.

Homan responded that “U.S. citizens” and “legal immigrants are perfectly safe, for God’s sakes.”

Late last month, in response to a question from journalist Cecilia Vega on CBS’s “60 Minutes” about the possibility of going forward with “mass deportation without separating families,” Homan said “there is” and that “Families can be deported together.”

Earlier in his interview on “The Evening Edit,” Homan said the Biden administration has “deported families together.”

“I mean, look … if these people demand due process, they demand the right to claim asylum, they demand the right [to see a judge], and we give them to ‘em at an [exorbitant] taxpayer cost, at the end of that due process, if [a] federal judge [says] ‘You must go home,’ they have to go home,” Homan added. “If they don’t, then what the hell are we doing?”",https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4985195-trumps-border-czar-to-critics-legal-immigrants-are-perfectly-safe/,"Tom Homan, appointed as President-elect Trump’s ""border czar,"" defended his immigration policies against criticisms from various public figures, clarifying that U.S. citizens and legal immigrants would not be deported.
