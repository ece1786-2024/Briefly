It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is Trump's pick for the position of director of national intelligence. The announcement was made on Wednesday.

The cabinet-level position involves overseeing the intelligence community and advising Trump and the National Security Council on intelligence matters. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and a U.S. Army reservist.

""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

President-elect Donald Trump nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State.

""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rubio is known as an Iran and China hawk. He is a top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and ran for president in 2016.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

If confirmed, Gaetz will oversee the Department of Justice after Trump's inauguration in January.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and quickly endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket, and has since repeatedly vowed to ""Make America Healthy Again.""

President-elect Trump announced Thursday that he is nominating Jay Clayton to serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Jay Clayton, of New York, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during my first term, where he did an incredible job, is hereby nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.

""Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,"" the president-elect added.

President-elect Trump announced on Thursday his intent to nominate former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to serve as secretary of veterans affairs.

""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.

""Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role,"" the president-elect added.

Trump announced Dean John Sauer as his pick for U.S. solicitor general.

""John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,"" Trump said in the announcement.

Sauer served as solicitor general of Missouri from 2017 to 2023, and represented Trump in his successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States.

President-elect Trump announced that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will lead the Department of the Interior during a speech at the Americans for Prosperity Gala at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's going to be announced [Friday]…I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now, actually,"" Trump said. ""He's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's going to be fantastic.""

Burgum, a multi-millionaire former software company CEO turned two-term governor, launched a White House bid in June 2023. The governor made energy and natural resources a key part of his campaign for the GOP nomination.

After he dropped out of the race, Burgum became a high profile surrogate for the former president, appearing on the campaign trail and in media hits on Trump’s behalf. He was in consideration as Trump’s running mate this past summer before Sen. JD Vance of Ohio was picked as the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee."

""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and quickly endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket, and has since repeatedly vowed to ""Make America Healthy Again.""

President-elect Trump announced Thursday that he is nominating Jay Clayton to serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Jay Clayton, of New York, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during my first term, where he did an incredible job, is hereby nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.

""Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,"" the president-elect added.

President-elect Trump announced on Thursday his intent to nominate former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to serve as secretary of veterans affairs.

""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.

""Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role,"" the president-elect added.

Trump announced Dean John Sauer as his pick for U.S. solicitor general.

""John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,"" Trump said in the announcement.

Sauer served as solicitor general of Missouri from 2017 to 2023, and represented Trump in his successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States.

President-elect Trump announced that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will lead the Department of the Interior during a speech at the Americans for Prosperity Gala at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's going to be announced [Friday]…I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now, actually,"" Trump said. ""He's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's going to be fantastic.""

Burgum, a multi-millionaire former software company CEO turned two-term governor, launched a White House bid in June 2023. The governor made energy and natural resources a key part of his campaign for the GOP nomination.

After he dropped out of the race, Burgum became a high profile surrogate for the former president, appearing on the campaign trail and in media hits on Trump’s behalf.

""Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is Trump's pick for the position of director of national intelligence. The announcement was made on Wednesday.

The cabinet-level position involves overseeing the intelligence community and advising Trump and the National Security Council on intelligence matters. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and a U.S. Army reservist.

""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

President-elect Donald Trump nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State.

""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rubio is known as an Iran and China hawk. He is a top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and ran for president in 2016.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

""Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is Trump's pick for the position of director of national intelligence. The announcement was made on Wednesday.

The cabinet-level position involves overseeing the intelligence community and advising Trump and the National Security Council on intelligence matters. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and a U.S. Army reservist.

""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

President-elect Donald Trump nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State.

""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rubio is known as an Iran and China hawk. He is a top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and ran for president in 2016.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

If confirmed, Gaetz will oversee the Department of Justice after Trump's inauguration in January.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and quickly endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket, and has since repeatedly vowed to ""Make America Healthy Again.""

President-elect Trump announced Thursday that he is nominating Jay Clayton to serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Jay Clayton, of New York, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during my first term, where he did an incredible job, is hereby nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.

""Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,"" the president-elect added.

President-elect Trump announced on Thursday his intent to nominate former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to serve as secretary of veterans affairs.

""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.

""Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role,"" the president-elect added.

Trump announced Dean John Sauer as his pick for U.S. solicitor general.

""John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,"" Trump said in the announcement.

Sauer served as solicitor general of Missouri from 2017 to 2023, and represented Trump in his successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States.

President-elect Trump announced that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will lead the Department of the Interior during a speech at the Americans for Prosperity Gala at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's going to be announced [Friday]…I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now, actually,"" Trump said. ""He's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's going to be fantastic.""

Burgum, a multi-millionaire former software company CEO turned two-term governor, launched a White House bid in June 2023. The governor made energy and natural resources a key part of his campaign for the GOP nomination.

After he dropped out of the race, Burgum became a high profile surrogate for the former president, appearing on the campaign trail and in media hits on Trump’s behalf. He was in consideration as Trump’s running mate this past summer before Sen. JD Vance of Ohio was picked as the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee.

Here is the summary:

President-elect Donald Trump has announced significant cabinet appointments, indicating a continuation of his previous term's focus on national security and strict immigration policies. Mike Waltz, chosen as National Security Adviser, is a known hawk on China and Iran, aligning with Trump's America First Foreign Policy, while Tom Homan, as ""Border Czar,"" reinforces Trump's zero-tolerance approach to immigration, having previously served under six administrations. Marco Rubio, tapped for Secretary of State, is recognized for his firm stance against Iran and China, potentially shaping international relations in favor of U.S allies and influencing future electoral strategies by aligning with conservative priorities.

""Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said in a statement.

THESE ARE THE TOP NAMES IN CONTENTION FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER TRUMP

Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican representative and current House GOP Conference Chair has been an attack dog for Trump in Congress.

She is a staunch supporter of Israel, having made headlines for her combative lines of questioning of Ivy League university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests, some of which prompted the presidents to resign.

On Tuesday, Trump announced the Florida Republican representative and former Army Green Beret would be his national security adviser. He’s decidedly a hawk on China and Iran.

""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""

Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was an architect of Trump's zero-tolerance policy during his first administration, one that led to backlash from family separations at the border.

Homan has served under six administrations and presidents in both parties, dating back to the Reagan era, as a rank-and-file Border Patrol agent. He was appointed to the position of executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE under President Obama.

While serving at a ""czar"" level rather than in an official Cabinet position, Homan will be in charge of ""the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" Trump announced on Truth Social.

""I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,"" Trump wrote. ""Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin. Congratulations to Tom. I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.""

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is a staunch supporter of Israel, prompted by his evangelical faith.

""Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him"", a statement attached to Trump’s Truth Social post said. ""Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!""

Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, had a notably strong, but unsuccessful, showing in the race for governor against Kathy Hochul in 2022.

During that race, he called for New York to lift its ban on fracking. He also lost his House race for re-election in 2022 but has maintained ties with the Trump team.

Witkoff, a real estate investor, landlord, and the founder of the Witkoff Group, was tapped as Trump's Middle East enjoy. He campaign with Trump during the campaign.

In his announcement, Trump said that Witkoff would be an ""unrelenting Voice for PEACE"" in the highly-contentious region.

McGinley, who served in Trump's first presidential term as White House cabinet secretary, returns to the White House for Trump's second term. The White House Counsel conducts key behind-the-scene research into potential Supreme Court nominees.

Ratcliffe previously served under Trump during his first term as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). He will head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In 2020, he was awarded the National Security Medal, the nation’s highest honor for distinguished achievement in the field of intelligence and national security.

Billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""

Trump nominated Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate to assume the position. Hegseth has long championed a strong military and veterans causes.

He served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army infantry officer, being awarded two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Hegseth was a host on ""FOX & Friends Weekend"" and FOX Nation until his last day on Tuesday.

""Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy,"" Trump said.

Trump announced on Tuesday that South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is his pick for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem would need to be approved by the Senate to assume the position.

DHS oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""She was the first Governor to send National Guard Soldiers to help Texas fight the Biden Border Crisis, and they were sent a total of eight times,"" the Trump transition team said in a statement on Tuesday. ""She will work closely with ‘Border Czar’ Tom Homan to secure the Border, and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.""

GOP REP. MIKE WALTZ TAPPED TO BE TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Trump announced that his longtime aide Dan Scavino Jr. will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff.

""Scavino was a Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" the Trump transition team said.

Trump announced Stephen Miller would serve as deputy chief of staff for policy in his administration. Miller was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term. He helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration.

Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal , an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech and religion and national security.

Miller has advocated for mass deportations during the second Trump term.

Trump announced James Blair would serve in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs.

""Blair was the Trump Campaign and Republican National Committee Political Director, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs,"" the Trump transition team said.

Blair was in charge of the Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operations in key battleground states, which Trump swept on Election Day.

Trump announced that Taylor Budowich will join him in the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.

""Prior to joining the Trump Campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in President Trump’s Leadership PAC, Save America, and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.,"" the Trump transition team said.

""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his senior campaign aides would be promoted to the White House. ""They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.""

Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is Trump's pick for the position of director of national intelligence. The announcement was made on Wednesday.

The cabinet-level position involves overseeing the intelligence community and advising Trump and the National Security Council on intelligence matters. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and a U.S. Army reservist.

""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

President-elect Donald Trump nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State.

""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""

Rubio is known as an Iran and China hawk. He is a top GOP member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and ran for president in 2016.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is Trump's pick for attorney general. The decision was made in an announcement on Wednesday.

If confirmed, Gaetz will oversee the Department of Justice after Trump's inauguration in January.

""Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,"" the president-elect said in Truth Social post. ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.""

""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" the post concluded.



Trump named his personal criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche as deputy attorney general. The president-elect said that the 50-year-old lawyer has experience prosecuting gangs – as well as representing Trump in his 2024 criminal trial in New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Todd Blanche will serve as Deputy Attorney General in my Administration. Todd is an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department, fixing what has been a broken System of Justice for far too long,"" Trump announced in a news release.

Trump announced he will tap former 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement Thursday.

""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.

Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August and quickly endorsed the Trump-Vance ticket, and has since repeatedly vowed to ""Make America Healthy Again.""

President-elect Trump announced Thursday that he is nominating Jay Clayton to serve as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""I am pleased to announce that Jay Clayton, of New York, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during my first term, where he did an incredible job, is hereby nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""Jay is a highly respected business leader, counsel, and public servant.

""Jay is going to be a strong Fighter for the Truth as we, Make America Great Again,"" the president-elect added.

President-elect Trump announced on Thursday his intent to nominate former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to serve as secretary of veterans affairs.

""Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need.

""Thank you, Doug, for your willingness to serve our country in this very important role,"" the president-elect added.

Trump announced Dean John Sauer as his pick for U.S. solicitor general.

""John is a deeply accomplished, masterful appellate attorney, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia in the United States Supreme Court, served as Solicitor General of Missouri for six years, and has extensive experience practicing before the U.S. Supreme Court and other Appellate Courts,"" Trump said in the announcement.

Sauer served as solicitor general of Missouri from 2017 to 2023, and represented Trump in his successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. United States.

President-elect Trump announced that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will lead the Department of the Interior during a speech at the Americans for Prosperity Gala at Mar-a-Lago.

""He's going to be announced [Friday]…I look forward to doing the formal announcement, although this is a pretty big announcement right now, actually,"" Trump said. ""He's going to head the Department of Interior, and he's going to be fantastic.""

Burgum, a multi-millionaire former software company CEO turned two-term governor, launched a White House bid in June 2023. The governor made energy and natural resources a key part of his campaign for the GOP nomination.

After he dropped out of the race, Burgum became a high profile surrogate for the former president, appearing on the campaign trail and in media hits on Trump’s behalf. He was in consideration as Trump’s running mate this past summer before Sen. JD Vance of Ohio was picked as the Republican Party’s vice presidential nominee.

Here is the summary:

Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has started filling key roles in his upcoming administration with a host of public appointments. Notable selections include Susie Wiles as Chief of Staff, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, alongside other high-profile figures like Mike Huckabee as Ambassador to Israel and Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence. These appointments highlight Trump's focus on national security, government efficiency, and restructuring critical departments as part of his ""Make America Great Again"" agenda.

The summary contains some inaccuracies and omissions:

1. The summary correctly mentions Susie Wiles as Chief of Staff, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mike Huckabee as Ambassador to Israel, and Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence.

2. However, it inaccurately provides an incomplete picture of Trump’s cabinet selections by omitting significant roles such as Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, Kristi Noem as Homeland Security Secretary, and others.

3. The focus on national security, government efficiency, and restructuring critical departments is briefly mentioned but lacks specificity in terms of Trump’s distinct picks for roles related to these areas.

4. Additionally, some nuances and specific remarks made by Trump regarding his appointees and their past experiences are not captured in the summary, particularly the detailed background of individuals like Tom Homan, Lee Zeldin, and others who play critical roles. 

A more comprehensive summary would reflect a broader overview of key appointments and their implications for Trump’s agenda."

 President-elect Donald Trump has nominated former Representative Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after 9/11 to remedy what American policy makers believed was a lack of coordination among the various national-intelligence agencies, and the DNI sits atop all of America’s intelligence services, including the CIA.

Gabbard is stunningly unqualified for almost any Cabinet post (as are some of Trump’s other picks), but especially for ODNI. She has no qualifications as an intelligence professional—literally none. (She is a reserve lieutenant colonel who previously served in the Hawaii Army National Guard, with assignments in medical, police, and civil-affairs-support positions. She has won some local elections and also represented Hawaii in Congress.) She has no significant experience directing or managing much of anything.

But leave aside for the moment that she is manifestly unprepared to run any kind of agency. Americans usually accept that presidents reward loyalists with jobs, and Trump has the right to stash Gabbard at some make-work office in the bureaucracy if he feels he owes her. It’s not a pretty tradition, but it’s not unprecedented, either.

To make Tulsi Gabbard the DNI, however, is not merely handing a bouquet to a political gadfly. Her appointment would be a threat to the security of the United States."

President-elect Donald Trump has named Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. A longtime Trump ally, Stefanik is a staunch supporter of Israel and has also been critical of the UN for what she argues is a lack of sufficient backing for its war against Hamas. “Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,” Trump said in a statement confirming the first cabinet pick of his second term. If confirmed, Stefanik would replace UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat who worked for the US Foreign Service for 35 years.

Stefanik said she was ""deeply humbled"" to accept Trump's nomination and was looking forward to ""earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate"", which must vote on her nomination to make it official. “America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,"" Stefanik added in a statement given to the New York Post. The New York Congresswoman has minimal experience in foreign policy and national security. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Since Hamas's 7 October attack, she has become one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel in Congress, garnering national attention as she led congressional hearings about university presidents' handling of protests on college campuses.

President-elect Donald Trump has named Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. A longtime Trump ally, Stefanik is a staunch supporter of Israel and has also been critical of the UN for what she argues is a lack of sufficient backing for its war against Hamas. “Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,” Trump said in a statement confirming the first cabinet pick of his second term. If confirmed, Stefanik would replace UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat who worked for the US Foreign Service for 35 years.

Stefanik said she was ""deeply humbled"" to accept Trump's nomination and was looking forward to ""earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate"", which must vote on her nomination to make it official. “America continues to be the beacon of the world, but we expect and must demand that our friends and allies be strong partners in the peace we seek,"" Stefanik added in a statement given to the New York Post. The New York Congresswoman has minimal experience in foreign policy and national security. She has served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Since Hamas's 7 October attack, she has become one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel in Congress, garnering national attention as she led congressional hearings about university presidents' handling of protests on college campuses.

President-elect Donald Trump says that Tom Homan, his former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as “border czar” in his incoming administration.

“I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation’s Borders,” he wrote late Sunday on his Truth Social site.

Homan was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border and Trump’s pledge to launch the largest deportation operation in the country’s history.

In addition to overseeing the southern and northern borders and “maritime, and aviation security,” Trump said Homan “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,” a central part of his agenda.

He says he had “no doubt” Homan “will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.”

In an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Homan said the military would not be rounding up and arresting immigrants in the country illegally and that ICE would move to implement Trump’s plans in a “humane manner.”

“It’s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They’re good at it,” he said. “When we go out there, we’re going to know who we’re looking for. We most likely know where they’re going to be, and it’s going to be done in a humane manner.”

Earlier this year at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, Homan expressed frustration at the news coverage of a mass deportation operation.

“Wait until 2025,” he said, adding that, while he thinks the government needed to prioritize national security threats, “no one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”

He also said: “you’ve got my word. Trump comes back in January, I’ll be in his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”

President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Tom Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as ""border czar,"" a position exempt from Senate confirmation, thereby streamlining Trump's immigration strategy implementation. Homan's role will center around overseeing all deportation efforts, aligning with Trump's agenda for a massive deportation operation, which reflects goals of ""Project 2025"" — a strategic initiative by conservatives aiming to solidify control over federal policy through significant enforcement actions and organizational changes. While emphasizing targeted operations conducted humanely, Homan has committed to executing the most extensive deportation plan in U.S. history.

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.

Miller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump and was his lead speechwriter during his first administration, has been a leading advocate for a more restrictive immigration policy and is expected to take on an expanded role in the president-elect’s second term. He’s been closely involved in Trump’s transition process and will have a key role in future staffing decisions. During the campaign, he frequently traveled to rallies with Trump on his private plane and was increasingly visible as a speaker at events in recent months.

Video Ad Feedback Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric sounds like 2016. Why things may be different if he wins in 2024 04:17 - Source: CNN

Miller is also a lead architect of the president-elect’s plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. He has said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the number of deportations to more than 1 million per year. In an interview on Fox News last week, Miller expressed eagerness at the prospect of beginning mass deportations as soon as possible.

“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.

Asked about the expected announcement, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN, “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.”

A longtime hardliner on immigration, Miller was instrumental in setting up immigration restrictions during the first Trump administration, advocating for child separation in migrant detention facilities and a travel ban targeting people from majority-Muslim countries.

After Trump left office, Miller started an advisory group called America First Legal, which went on to contribute to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president created by the Heritage Foundation. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025, claiming that he had no idea who was behind it, despite its close ties to Miller and other crucial figures in Trump’s orbit.

In an interview with The New York Times last year, Miller said that under a second Trump term, the military would build detention centers to house immigrants who have been arrested and are facing deportation. The new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border,” he told The Times.

Miller told The Times that Trump’s immigration plans are being designed to avoid having to create new substantial legislation. During Trump’s first term, he relied heavily on executive orders to implement immigration policy. Many of those moves were challenged in the courts, something Miller acknowledged would likely happen again in a second Trump term.

In his comments last year, Miller was up-front about his belief that Trump would not hesitate to implement harsh immigration measures in a second term.

“Any activists who doubt President Trump’s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,” Miller said at the time.

 CNN —

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.

Miller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump and was his lead speechwriter during his first administration, has been a leading advocate for a more restrictive immigration policy and is expected to take on an expanded role in the president-elect’s second term. He’s been closely involved in Trump’s transition process and will have a key role in future staffing decisions. During the campaign, he frequently traveled to rallies with Trump on his private plane and was increasingly visible as a speaker at events in recent months.

Video Ad Feedback Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric sounds like 2016. Why things may be different if he wins in 2024 04:17 - Source: CNN

Miller is also a lead architect of the president-elect’s plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. He has said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the number of deportations to more than 1 million per year. In an interview on Fox News last week, Miller expressed eagerness at the prospect of beginning mass deportations as soon as possible.

“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.

Asked about the expected announcement, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN, “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.”

A longtime hardliner on immigration, Miller was instrumental in setting up immigration restrictions during the first Trump administration, advocating for child separation in migrant detention facilities and a travel ban targeting people from majority-Muslim countries.

After Trump left office, Miller started an advisory group called America First Legal, which went on to contribute to Project 2025, the sweeping conservative blueprint for the next Republican president created by the Heritage Foundation. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025, claiming that he had no idea who was behind it, despite its close ties to Miller and other crucial figures in Trump’s orbit.

In an interview with The New York Times last year, Miller said that under a second Trump term, the military would build detention centers to house immigrants who have been arrested and are facing deportation. The new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border,” he told The Times.

Miller told The Times that Trump’s immigration plans are being designed to avoid having to create new substantial legislation. During Trump’s first term, he relied heavily on executive orders to implement immigration policy. Many of those moves were challenged in the courts, something Miller acknowledged would likely happen again in a second Trump term.

In his comments last year, Miller was up-front about his belief that Trump would not hesitate to implement harsh immigration measures in a second term.

“Any activists who doubt President Trump’s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,” Miller said at the time.

2024-11-15 17:52:07,Summarization Agent,user,"Please summarize the following article: This story was originally published by Grist and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters, 62 percent, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.

On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.

“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”

Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.

Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as politically risky. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.

The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”

Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among a network of states in the East, but Washington’s law is more ambitious, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.

“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguy?n, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts.

The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.

Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising $16 million. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.

The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite appeals to the state Supreme Court by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to $5, the highest in the country, in 2023 — have now come down to around $4 a gallon.

Another ballot initiative, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy.

Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.

The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguy?n said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”"
2024-11-15 17:52:07,Summarization Agent,assistant,"Washington state voters upheld the Climate Commitment Act, a cap-and-trade law, by rejecting a ballot initiative aimed at its repeal, thereby preserving efforts to reduce emissions significantly by 2050. This decision was seen as a national example, with political leaders emphasizing the local economic and environmental benefits that helped secure public backing amid rising opposition citing increased gas prices. The law’s continuation allows the state to further integrate its carbon market with those of California and Quebec and proceed with initiatives like reducing air pollution in affected communities."

“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”

Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.

Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as politically risky. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.

The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”

Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among a network of states in the East, but Washington’s law is more ambitious, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.

“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguy?n, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts.

The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.

Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising $16 million. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.

The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite appeals to the state Supreme Court by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to $5, the highest in the country, in 2023 — have now come down to around $4 a gallon.

Another ballot initiative, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy.

Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.

The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguy?n said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”"

The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters, 62 percent, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.

On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.

The people of Washington state elected to save the most ambitious price on carbon in the country. A large majority of voters, 62 percent, rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the state’s Climate Commitment Act, the cap-and-trade law that has already raised more than $2 billion for cleaning up transportation, shifting to clean energy, and helping people adapt to the effects of a changing climate.

On an otherwise depressing election night for voters who consider climate change a top concern, there was an air of victory at the Seattle Convention Center on Tuesday evening, where Gov. Jay Inslee and a couple hundred organizers with the campaign opposing the repeal gathered for a watch party. As news rolled in that former President Donald Trump was the favorite to win the presidential election, many in the crowd did their best to focus on their success in rescuing the state’s landmark carbon-cutting law. Inslee, the outgoing Democratic governor whose signature climate legislation was at risk, said that the results should embolden states to take action on climate change.

“I really feel it was important from a national perspective, because every state legislator can now look to Washington and say, ‘This is a winning issue,’” Inslee said in an interview with Grist. “This is something you can defend and win big on. And we won big.”

Inslee said that the effort to defeat the initiative had emphasized the concrete, local benefits of the program to voters, rather than getting into the weeds about how cap and trade works. “We focused on the easiest thing for people to wrap their minds and hearts around,” Inslee said, pointing to the tangible economic benefits that the repeal would take away: the funding for transportation, schools, and fighting fires.

Putting any kind of price on carbon has long been seen as politically risky. Opponents of Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, including Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager driving the repeal effort, blamed it for raising gas prices. The ballot measure would have not only struck down the state’s price on pollution — it would have also prevented the state from ever enacting a similar policy in the future.

The resounding public support for Washington’s cap-and-trade program “is going to echo coast to coast,” said Democratic state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, who helped pass the legislation in 2021, during a speech at the convention center. Officials in states including New Jersey, Maryland, and New York have been eyeing similar policies, and they’ve been watching the results in Washington to see how voters responded. “I know that there are states that are thinking, ‘What can we do?’” Fitzgibbon told Grist. “And especially when there’s a vacuum at the federal level, that’s when I think you see the most motivation in state capitols to move.”

Cap and trade already exists in California, and in a more limited form among a network of states in the East, but Washington’s law is more ambitious, aiming to slash emissions nearly in half by 2030, using 1990 levels as a baseline, and by 95 percent by 2050.

“Washington state is the gold standard for how we tackle climate change in a way that’s inclusive, in a way that’s politically popular, in a way that actually will decarbonize,” said state Sen. Joe Nguy?n, a Democrat who chairs the state’s Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee. A review of existing climate policies in 41 countries in August found that carbon pricing programs were the most likely of any policy to lead to large emissions cuts.

The Climate Commitment Act’s passage in 2021 followed more than a decade of failed attempts to put a price on pollution in Washington state. It requires companies to buy pollution permits at quarterly auctions, a way to generate money for climate solutions and at the same time incentivize businesses to reduce their emissions. The number of permits available decreases over time. The program has so far raised billions to make public transit free for youth, install energy-efficient heat pumps in homes, and reduce local air pollution, among other measures.

Across the state, almost 600 organizations joined the “No on 2117” coalition to defend the law in 2024, ultimately raising $16 million. Many businesses, religious organizations, health advocates, and agricultural organizations were on board. At the event Tuesday, there were security guards representing unionized labor, the chair of the Suquamish Tribe, and a public policy manager from the tech giant Amazon. “We put together, all of us, the most extraordinary coalition in the history of this state, on any issue, ever,” said Gregg Small, executive director of the group Climate Solutions, in a speech at the convention center.

The initiative faced other headwinds. Ballots explicitly alerted voters to the fiscal costs of the repeal, despite appeals to the state Supreme Court by the Washington State Republican Party to get that language removed. And Washington’s gas prices — which soared to $5, the highest in the country, in 2023 — have now come down to around $4 a gallon.

Another ballot initiative, which would complicate the state’s plans to get off natural gas, was still too close to call on Friday. With ballots still left to count, 51 percent of voters approved of the measure, which targets new building codes that make installing natural gas more difficult and legislation to help the state’s largest utility accelerate its use of clean energy.

Now that Washington’s cap-and-trade program survived the repeal, the state can move forward with plans to link its carbon market up with California and Quebec’s. The state can also begin the years-long process of implementing the Climate Commitment Act’s program to regulate air quality. This summer, the state began releasing grants to help reduce air pollution in “overburdened” communities, but much of the work had been on hold as the state waited to see if voters would keep the law, according to David Mendoza, the director of public advocacy and engagement at the Nature Conservancy in Washington state.

The whole repeal initiative might have been a blessing in disguise, Nguy?n said. It gave people a chance to pay attention to all the work the state had done on climate change that might otherwise have been ignored. “I actually want to thank Brian Heywood and his cronies for putting this on the ballot, and just reaffirming to everybody that we care about climate change in Washington state.”

Here is the summary:

The resounding support for Washington's Climate Commitment Act could significantly influence voter behavior and candidate platforms in the 2024 U.S. elections, especially in swing states, by demonstrating that climate policy can be a winning issue. Moreover, this state-level success may spur other states like New Jersey, Maryland, and New York to adopt similar policies, potentially creating pressure on federal policymakers to advance more comprehensive national climate strategies. The act's innovative cap-and-trade program, already generating over $2 billion for clean energy initiatives, underscores the role state-led efforts play in shaping broader political dynamics and climate policymaking trends in the absence of decisive federal action.

Washington state's voters affirmed the ambitious Climate Commitment Act, showcasing the state's progressive political stance and underscoring its potential to influence federal climate policies amid national inaction. This decision reflects strong public support for state-led climate initiatives, offering a model for other states and highlighting the potential political advantage for pro-climate candidates ahead of the 2024 US elections. Governor Jay Inslee and Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon emphasized the victory's significance in encouraging other states to adopt similar policies, offering a counter-narrative to figures opposing climate action, such as Donald Trump.

The summary includes several inaccuracies:

1. ""Washington state's voters affirmed the ambitious Climate Commitment Act"" - The article describes how voters rejected a ballot initiative to repeal the act, which is different from actively affirming it.

2. ""Showcasing the state's progressive political stance and underscoring its potential to influence federal climate policies amid national inaction"" - While the article mentions the victory in terms of emboldening states to act on climate, it doesn't explicitly link Washington's stance to influencing federal policies.

3. ""Offering a model for other states and highlighting the potential political advantage for pro-climate candidates ahead of the 2024 US elections"" - The article discusses the implications for other states, but does not explicitly mention the potential advantages for pro-climate candidates in the 2024 elections.

4. ""Offering a counter-narrative to figures opposing climate action, such as Donald Trump"" - The article mentions Trump in the context of the presidential election, but does not frame the victory as a counter-narrative specifically against him.

Overall, while the summary captures some key themes from the article, it introduces elements not explicitly covered, leading to inaccuracies in representation."

Washington state voters upheld the Climate Commitment Act, a cap-and-trade law, by rejecting a ballot initiative aimed at its repeal, thereby preserving efforts to reduce emissions significantly by 2050. This decision was seen as a national example, with political leaders emphasizing the local economic and environmental benefits that helped secure public backing amid rising opposition citing increased gas prices. The law’s continuation allows the state to further integrate its carbon market with those of California and Quebec and proceed with initiatives like reducing air pollution in affected communities.

2024-11-15 17:52:41,Summarization Agent,user,"Please summarize the following article: Russia denies Trump call with Putin urging restraint in Ukraine

Putin and Trump pictured together at a summit in Vietnam in 2017

A Kremlin spokesperson said the reports were ""pure fiction"", while Trump's team told the BBC that it would not comment on the president-elect's ""private calls"".

Trump is also reported to have mentioned America's extensive military presence in Europe to Putin.

The call, which was first reported by the Washington Post on Sunday, is said to have happened on Thursday.

The Kremlin has denied media reports that US President-elect Donald Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, in which he is said to have warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.

Trump's communications director Steven Cheung told the BBC: ""We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.""

But he said leaders had begun the process of contacting the president-elect.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied a conversation had taken place.

""This is completely untrue, it is pure fiction. That is, this is simply false information. There was no conversation,"" Peskov said.

Trump has promised to end the nearly three-year long war in Ukraine, but has yet to outline how he intends to do so.

Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war.

While Peskov on Sunday spoke to Russian state media of ""positive"" signals from the incoming US administration, others say they trust the future president will not abandon Ukraine.

They include John Healey, the British defence secretary, who said he expected the US ""to remain alongside allies like the UK, standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes to prevail over Putin's invasion"".

On Sunday, during a visit to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that any end to the war needed to be sustainable.

""This is a warning for the ones who say, this war has to end, so let's finish it as soon as possible no matter how. How matters,"" he said.

In Washington, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said outgoing president Joe Biden would make the case to Trump that walking away from Ukraine would mean greater instability in Europe.

On Monday, Germany's Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned that Putin could take advantage of the US post-election transition period to press Moscow's advantage in Ukraine.

Urging Berlin and fellow European Union member states to increase aid to Kyiv, she said: ""We don't have time to wait until spring. Now is the transition phase that Putin has been waiting for and aiming for.""

A dam close to the front line in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region was damaged on Monday, according to regional head Vadym Filashkin.

Filashkin said the Kurakhove reservoir's dam was hit by a Russian strike, warning rising water ""potentially threatens"" settlements on the Vovcha River. Russia claimed Ukraine was responsible.

Last week, Russia and Ukraine launched their largest drone attacks since the start of the war."

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied a conversation had taken place.

""This is completely untrue, it is pure fiction. That is, this is simply false information. There was no conversation,"" Peskov said.

Trump has promised to end the nearly three-year long war in Ukraine, but has yet to outline how he intends to do so.

Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war.

While Peskov on Sunday spoke to Russian state media of ""positive"" signals from the incoming US administration, others say they trust the future president will not abandon Ukraine.

On Sunday, during a visit to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that any end to the war needed to be sustainable.

""This is a warning for the ones who say, this war has to end, so let's finish it as soon as possible no matter how. How matters,"" he said.

In Washington, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said outgoing president Joe Biden would make the case to Trump that walking away from Ukraine would mean greater instability in Europe.

On Monday, Germany's Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, warned that Putin could take advantage of the US post-election transition period to press Moscow's advantage in Ukraine.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz faces a new era of divided government when he returns home from the presidential campaign trail, now that Republicans appear to have broken the Democratic trifecta that helped put him on Kamala Harris’ radar.

While Democrats will keep their one-seat majority in the Senate, leaders on both sides agree that Republicans gained enough seats in the election to tie control of the House at 67-67.

According to a tally by The Associated Press, the chamber stood at 65-65 Wednesday afternoon. It would end in a 67-67 tie if the leaders of the last four undeclared races remain ahead. Two of them are so razor-thin that automatic recounts have been triggered unless lawmakers waive them.

The last time the House was tied was in 1979, and the history of that legislative session suggests that power-sharing will be contentious.

In House District 14B, in the St. Cloud area, Democratic incumbent Dan Wolgamott led by just 28 votes over Republican Sue Ek in unofficial results as of midday Wednesday, while in District 54A, in the Shakopee area, incumbent Democrat Brad Tabke led Republican Aaron Paul by just 13 votes. Two other races had margins of 225 votes and 160 votes with 99% of the votes counted.

Recounts in legislative races rarely change outcomes, according to Minnesota’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Library. Fluctuations in the vote totals, if any, usually stay within single digits. The prominent exception in recent decades was in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate race in 2008, when Democrat Al Franken came from behind to unseat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes after an eight-month recount and court battle.

While Democratic legislative leaders warned ahead of the 2024 election that split control would be a recipe for gridlock, both sides tried to sound optimistic notes at news conferences Wednesday afternoon. They said they’ve hardly begun to discuss what their power-sharing agreement might look like as they contemplate their main task of the 2025 session, passing a balanced budget. Among the questions is who will be speaker of the House.

The current minority leader, Republican Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said the tie will mean “balance” after two years of full Democratic control.

“This is the opportunity for us to work together with our colleagues, the Democrats across the aisle, and find ways to best serve Minnesotans,” Demuth told reporters.

The current speaker, Democrat Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, acknowledged that she’d like to keep the job but agreed that everything will have to be negotiated.

“There will be an opportunity for us to show Minnesotans some good bipartisan working together and getting things done,” Hortman told reporters. ”Minnesotans certainly sent us a tied Minnesota House. What they are asking us to do is to work together and be productive.”

Hortman said she and Demuth already have “a great friendship and working relationship to build on.” She also noted that she worked well with Senate Republicans when that body was under GOP control. Power-sharing works when lawmakers treat each other with respect and “fundamental decency” and keep their word, she said.

Minnesota has usually had some degree of divided government over the last several decades. The 2019 session — the first under Walz — wasn’t always pretty, but both sides agreed it was fairly productive despite Republicans holding the Senate and Democrats controlling the House.

Democrats gained their trifecta — control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers — in the 2022 election and used it to enact a long list of pent-up priorities last year. Those included stronger protections for abortion rights and trans rights, child tax credits, paid family and medical leave, free school meals for all kids and gun safety measures, to name just a few.

Democrats also held full power under Gov. Mark Dayton in the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions and in the four sessions from 1987-1990 under Gov. Rudy Perpich. But Minnesota Republicans haven’t had a trifecta since the late 1960s under Gov. Harold LeVander, when legislative races were technically nonpartisan and lawmakers caucused as either conservatives or liberals.

In 1979, GOP and Democratic leaders came up with a power-sharing agreement after weeks of difficult negotiations that gave Republicans the speakership, while Democrats got the chairmanships of the three most powerful committees. The arrangement worked fairly smoothly for most of the session. Bills that advanced through the process generally had bipartisan support. But the deal fell apart in the closing days, and lawmakers needed a one-day special session to finish off the year’s must-pass bills.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz faces a new era of divided government when he returns home from the presidential campaign trail, now that Republicans appear to have broken the Democratic trifecta that helped put him on Kamala Harris’ radar.

While Democrats will keep their one-seat majority in the Senate, leaders on both sides agree that Republicans gained enough seats in the election to tie control of the House at 67-67.

According to a tally by The Associated Press, the chamber stood at 65-65 Wednesday afternoon. It would end in a 67-67 tie if the leaders of the last four undeclared races remain ahead. Two of them are so razor-thin that automatic recounts have been triggered unless lawmakers waive them.

The last time the House was tied was in 1979, and the history of that legislative session suggests that power-sharing will be contentious.

In House District 14B, in the St. Cloud area, Democratic incumbent Dan Wolgamott led by just 28 votes over Republican Sue Ek in unofficial results as of midday Wednesday, while in District 54A, in the Shakopee area, incumbent Democrat Brad Tabke led Republican Aaron Paul by just 13 votes. Two other races had margins of 225 votes and 160 votes with 99% of the votes counted.

Recounts in legislative races rarely change outcomes, according to Minnesota’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Library. Fluctuations in the vote totals, if any, usually stay within single digits. The prominent exception in recent decades was in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate race in 2008, when Democrat Al Franken came from behind to unseat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes after an eight-month recount and court battle.

While Democratic legislative leaders warned ahead of the 2024 election that split control would be a recipe for gridlock, both sides tried to sound optimistic notes at news conferences Wednesday afternoon. They said they’ve hardly begun to discuss what their power-sharing agreement might look like as they contemplate their main task of the 2025 session, passing a balanced budget. Among the questions is who will be speaker of the House.

The current minority leader, Republican Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said the tie will mean “balance” after two years of full Democratic control.

“This is the opportunity for us to work together with our colleagues, the Democrats across the aisle, and find ways to best serve Minnesotans,” Demuth told reporters.

The current speaker, Democrat Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, acknowledged that she’d like to keep the job but agreed that everything will have to be negotiated.

“There will be an opportunity for us to show Minnesotans some good bipartisan working together and getting things done,” Hortman told reporters. ”Minnesotans certainly sent us a tied Minnesota House. What they are asking us to do is to work together and be productive.”

Hortman said she and Demuth already have “a great friendship and working relationship to build on.” She also noted that she worked well with Senate Republicans when that body was under GOP control. Power-sharing works when lawmakers treat each other with respect and “fundamental decency” and keep their word, she said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz faces a new era of divided government when he returns home from the presidential campaign trail, now that Republicans appear to have broken the Democratic trifecta that helped put him on Kamala Harris’ radar.

While Democrats will keep their one-seat majority in the Senate, leaders on both sides agree that Republicans gained enough seats in the election to tie control of the House at 67-67.

According to a tally by The Associated Press, the chamber stood at 65-65 Wednesday afternoon. It would end in a 67-67 tie if the leaders of the last four undeclared races remain ahead. Two of them are so razor-thin that automatic recounts have been triggered unless lawmakers waive them.

The last time the House was tied was in 1979, and the history of that legislative session suggests that power-sharing will be contentious.

In House District 14B, in the St. Cloud area, Democratic incumbent Dan Wolgamott led by just 28 votes over Republican Sue Ek in unofficial results as of midday Wednesday, while in District 54A, in the Shakopee area, incumbent Democrat Brad Tabke led Republican Aaron Paul by just 13 votes. Two other races had margins of 225 votes and 160 votes with 99% of the votes counted.

Recounts in legislative races rarely change outcomes, according to Minnesota’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Library. Fluctuations in the vote totals, if any, usually stay within single digits. The prominent exception in recent decades was in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate race in 2008, when Democrat Al Franken came from behind to unseat Republican Norm Coleman by 312 votes after an eight-month recount and court battle.

While Democratic legislative leaders warned ahead of the 2024 election that split control would be a recipe for gridlock, both sides tried to sound optimistic notes at news conferences Wednesday afternoon. They said they’ve hardly begun to discuss what their power-sharing agreement might look like as they contemplate their main task of the 2025 session, passing a balanced budget. Among the questions is who will be speaker of the House.

The current minority leader, Republican Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said the tie will mean “balance” after two years of full Democratic control.

“This is the opportunity for us to work together with our colleagues, the Democrats across the aisle, and find ways to best serve Minnesotans,” Demuth told reporters.

The current speaker, Democrat Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, acknowledged that she’d like to keep the job but agreed that everything will have to be negotiated.

“There will be an opportunity for us to show Minnesotans some good bipartisan working together and getting things done,” Hortman told reporters. ”Minnesotans certainly sent us a tied Minnesota House. What they are asking us to do is to work together and be productive.”

Hortman said she and Demuth already have “a great friendship and working relationship to build on.” She also noted that she worked well with Senate Republicans when that body was under GOP control. Power-sharing works when lawmakers treat each other with respect and “fundamental decency” and keep their word, she said.

Minnesota has usually had some degree of divided government over the last several decades. The 2019 session — the first under Walz — wasn’t always pretty, but both sides agreed it was fairly productive despite Republicans holding the Senate and Democrats controlling the House.

Democrats gained their trifecta — control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers — in the 2022 election and used it to enact a long list of pent-up priorities last year. Those included stronger protections for abortion rights and trans rights, child tax credits, paid family and medical leave, free school meals for all kids and gun safety measures, to name just a few.

Democrats also held full power under Gov. Mark Dayton in the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions and in the four sessions from 1987-1990 under Gov. Rudy Perpich.

The summary incorrectly emphasizes that the Democratic trifecta was central to Governor Tim Walz's ability to achieve significant legislative milestones, which were merely examples of what was done under such a trifecta. The article does highlight the loss of the trifecta due to the tie in the House but doesn't directly connect it to specific strategies or national movements.

Top Senate Republicans are withholding support for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, while Democrats and at least one prominent GOP senator call for the release of an ethics report into the former congressman.

Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he “absolutely” wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s findings on Gaetz. “I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,” he said.

A long-awaited report from the ethics panel was expected to be released as soon as Friday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. But Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced his intent to nominate the Florida Republican to be attorney general and it is now uncertain if the information will ever be made public. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Ad Feedback

Republicans on the ethics panel canceled a scheduled Friday meeting with Democrats that was expected to address the long-awaited report, according to two sources familiar. The Republican members huddled privately Thursday night but declined to comment to reporters as they left.

The Gaetz nomination could set up a major clash between Trump and the new Senate GOP majority as the president-elect has vowed to get his nominees installed.

Ad Feedback

Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, will face an early test over the controversial nomination and can only afford three defections if Republicans end up with 53 seats.

Trump has pushed to keep all options on the table to greenlight his nominees, including recess appointments, which would bypass the typical Senate confirmation process.

But several GOP senators have expressed reservations over that prospect, creating another potential point of contention with the president-elect.

Sen. James Lankford, a newly elected member of GOP leadership, argued that the use of recess appointments “shows the Senate is not doing their work.”

“That’s a totally different issue. I think the Supreme Court would even step in on those roles,” he said. “The Supreme Court has already spoken to the time period it would take. Quite frankly the Senate should be here, do its work. A recess has to be more than two weeks already, and that would say that Congress is not here already doing its tasks. So we need to be able to be here and do its tasks.”

“I don’t think we should be circumventing the Senate’s responsibilities,” Cornyn told CNN. “But I think it’s premature to be talking about recess appointments right now.” Previously, when he was running for GOP leader, Cornyn had indicated that he was open to using recess appointments to bypass Democratic opposition to Trump’s nominees.

However, Sen. Rick Scott told CNN, “I believe in recess appointments.” Scott had supported recess appointments during his bid for GOP leader, which he lost to Thune.

Scott also indicated his support for Trump’s intended nomination of Gaetz, saying, “I think he’ll do a good job.”

Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, as well as other top Senate Democrats on the committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Chris Coons, called on the ethics panel to release its findings and raised concerns over Gaetz’s move to resign before the report came out. The ethics panel only has jurisdiction over a member when they are serving in Congress.

Durbin told CNN, “The timing of the resignation and flight with President-elect Donald Trump suggests that he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable, so I want to read the report and find out what the investigation behind it brought out.”

Blumenthal said, “Matt Gaetz has chosen to resign from the House, but he can’t choose to conceal that information.”

Coons added that Trump “is entitled to his nominations, but he’s not entitled to a confirmation of any, literally any, nominee.”

Asked if the Senate should get the House ethics report on Gaetz, Thune said, “I haven’t given that any thought yet. I just know that the nomination isn’t formalized yet, but when it is, we’ll process it in the way we typically do and provide our advise and consent.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is set to reclaim the chair of the committee in charge of vetting Trump’s judicial nominees, would not say if he’d ask for the House Ethics report in the vetting process his committee will do.

“We’ve got a professional staff on Judiciary that will do a full job of vetting and all those questions (about Gaetz) will be answered by the vetting process,” Grassley said.

Top Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis, were careful to keep their options open on the nomination.

Tillis said it is “up to” the ethics committee, and Graham said, “I don’t know what the rules are.” Sen. Josh Hawley added, “That’s really a matter for the House.”

Graham said that he has “voted for a lot of people I didn’t like,” and said, “The process I will follow here is what I’ve done with everybody. Elections have consequences, he chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee, and he will be asked hard questions, and we’ll see.”

Tillis said, “I barely know Gaetz. All I know is he likes to pick fights on social media. You’ll have to deal with that in committees. But I don’t know his background.”

Pressed on whether he would support Gaetz’s nomination, Tillis said, “I expect us to treat every nominee coming from an administration, whether they’re Democrat or Republican, with respect, but at the end of the day, you got to have the votes and you better have the resume. That’s how this process works.”

And Cornyn did not rule out backing Gaetz. “We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees, and that’s where all the questions that you have and that we have will be considered under oath,” he told reporters. “So that’s a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the judiciary committee.”

Controversy over recess appointments

There is very little that Democrats can do if Republicans insist on moving forward with recess appointments. If the two houses of Congress want to put the Senate into a recess long enough for the recess appointment window to open, it just takes a concurrent adjournment resolution of the two chambers.

That can pass with a simple majority in the House and the Senate. And Republicans will have a majority in both.

That doesn’t mean Democrats wouldn’t, or couldn’t, try to fight it. These adjournment resolutions are not debatable but they are amendable so Democrats could try and delay this with a vote-a-rama-style amendment process, but those last only hours, not long enough to block a cabinet pick forever.

The Supreme Court has ruled on questions about recess appointments, which makes the outcome of taking these questions to court uncertain. But, multiple sources warned CNN that it’s too soon to know how Democrats would proceed if Thune really did move ahead with this tactic.

Ultimately, Democrats’ best defense against recess appointments may be Republicans senators themselves. The Senate would have to pass an adjournment resolution with a simple majority and that means, again, Thune couldn’t lose more than a handful of his GOP members.

The key question then would be whether some Republicans would be willing to stand in the way of the executive branch circumventing their advise and consent role.

Article: 
 CNN —

Top Senate Republicans are withholding support for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, while Democrats and at least one prominent GOP senator call for the release of an ethics report into the former congressman.

Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he “absolutely” wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s findings on Gaetz. “I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,” he said.

A long-awaited report from the ethics panel was expected to be released as soon as Friday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. But Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced his intent to nominate the Florida Republican to be attorney general and it is now uncertain if the information will ever be made public. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Ad Feedback

Republicans on the ethics panel canceled a scheduled Friday meeting with Democrats that was expected to address the long-awaited report, according to two sources familiar. The Republican members huddled privately Thursday night but declined to comment to reporters as they left.

The Gaetz nomination could set up a major clash between Trump and the new Senate GOP majority as the president-elect has vowed to get his nominees installed.

Ad Feedback

Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, will face an early test over the controversial nomination and can only afford three defections if Republicans end up with 53 seats.

Trump has pushed to keep all options on the table to greenlight his nominees, including recess appointments, which would bypass the typical Senate confirmation process.

But several GOP senators have expressed reservations over that prospect, creating another potential point of contention with the president-elect.

Sen. James Lankford, a newly elected member of GOP leadership, argued that the use of recess appointments “shows the Senate is not doing their work.”

“That’s a totally different issue. I think the Supreme Court would even step in on those roles,” he said. “The Supreme Court has already spoken to the time period it would take. Quite frankly the Senate should be here, do its work. A recess has to be more than two weeks already, and that would say that Congress is not here already doing its tasks. So we need to be able to be here and do its tasks.”

“I don’t think we should be circumventing the Senate’s responsibilities,” Cornyn told CNN. “But I think it’s premature to be talking about recess appointments right now.” Previously, when he was running for GOP leader, Cornyn had indicated that he was open to using recess appointments to bypass Democratic opposition to Trump’s nominees.

However, Sen. Rick Scott told CNN, “I believe in recess appointments.” Scott had supported recess appointments during his bid for GOP leader, which he lost to Thune.

Scott also indicated his support for Trump’s intended nomination of Gaetz, saying, “I think he’ll do a good job.”

Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, as well as other top Senate Democrats on the committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Chris Coons, called on the ethics panel to release its findings and raised concerns over Gaetz’s move to resign before the report came out. The ethics panel only has jurisdiction over a member when they are serving in Congress.

Durbin told CNN, “The timing of the resignation and flight with President-elect Donald Trump suggests that he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable, so I want to read the report and find out what the investigation behind it brought out.”

 CNN —

Top Senate Republicans are withholding support for President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, while Democrats and at least one prominent GOP senator call for the release of an ethics report into the former congressman.

Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he “absolutely” wants to see the House Ethics Committee’s findings on Gaetz. “I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,” he said.

A long-awaited report from the ethics panel was expected to be released as soon as Friday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. But Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump announced his intent to nominate the Florida Republican to be attorney general and it is now uncertain if the information will ever be made public. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Republicans on the ethics panel canceled a scheduled Friday meeting with Democrats that was expected to address the long-awaited report, according to two sources familiar. The Republican members huddled privately Thursday night but declined to comment to reporters as they left.

The Gaetz nomination could set up a major clash between Trump and the new Senate GOP majority as the president-elect has vowed to get his nominees installed.

Ad Feedback

Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, will face an early test over the controversial nomination and can only afford three defections if Republicans end up with 53 seats.

Trump has pushed to keep all options on the table to greenlight his nominees, including recess appointments, which would bypass the typical Senate confirmation process.

But several GOP senators have expressed reservations over that prospect, creating another potential point of contention with the president-elect.

Sen. James Lankford, a newly elected member of GOP leadership, argued that the use of recess appointments “shows the Senate is not doing their work.”

“That’s a totally different issue. I think the Supreme Court would even step in on those roles,” he said. “The Supreme Court has already spoken to the time period it would take. Quite frankly the Senate should be here, do its work. A recess has to be more than two weeks already, and that would say that Congress is not here already doing its tasks. So we need to be able to be here and do its tasks.”

“I don’t think we should be circumventing the Senate’s responsibilities,” Cornyn told CNN. “But I think it’s premature to be talking about recess appointments right now.” Previously, when he was running for GOP leader, Cornyn had indicated that he was open to using recess appointments to bypass Democratic opposition to Trump’s nominees.

However, Sen. Rick Scott told CNN, “I believe in recess appointments.” Scott had supported recess appointments during his bid for GOP leader, which he lost to Thune.

Scott also indicated his support for Trump’s intended nomination of Gaetz, saying, “I think he’ll do a good job.”

Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, as well as other top Senate Democrats on the committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Chris Coons, called on the ethics panel to release its findings and raised concerns over Gaetz’s move to resign before the report came out. The ethics panel only has jurisdiction over a member when they are serving in Congress.

Durbin told CNN, “The timing of the resignation and flight with President-elect Donald Trump suggests that he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable, so I want to read the report and find out what the investigation behind it brought out.”

Blumenthal said, “Matt Gaetz has chosen to resign from the House, but he can’t choose to conceal that information.”

Coons added that Trump “is entitled to his nominations, but he’s not entitled to a confirmation of any, literally any, nominee.”

Asked if the Senate should get the House ethics report on Gaetz, Thune said, “I haven’t given that any thought yet. I just know that the nomination isn’t formalized yet, but when it is, we’ll process it in the way we typically do and provide our advise and consent.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is set to reclaim the chair of the committee in charge of vetting Trump’s judicial nominees, would not say if he’d ask for the House Ethics report in the vetting process his committee will do.

“We’ve got a professional staff on Judiciary that will do a full job of vetting and all those questions (about Gaetz) will be answered by the vetting process,” Grassley said.

Top Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis, were careful to keep their options open on the nomination.

Tillis said it is “up to” the ethics committee, and Graham said, “I don’t know what the rules are.” Sen. Josh Hawley added, “That’s really a matter for the House.”

Graham said that he has “voted for a lot of people I didn’t like,” and said, “The process I will follow here is what I’ve done with everybody. Elections have consequences, he chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee, and he will be asked hard questions, and we’ll see.”

Tillis said, “I barely know Gaetz. All I know is he likes to pick fights on social media. You’ll have to deal with that in committees. But I don’t know his background.”

Pressed on whether he would support Gaetz’s nomination, Tillis said, “I expect us to treat every nominee coming from an administration, whether they’re Democrat or Republican, with respect, but at the end of the day, you got to have the votes and you better have the resume. That’s how this process works.”

And Cornyn did not rule out backing Gaetz. “We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees, and that’s where all the questions that you have and that we have will be considered under oath,” he told reporters. “So that’s a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the judiciary committee.”

Controversy over recess appointments

There is very little that Democrats can do if Republicans insist on moving forward with recess appointments. If the two houses of Congress want to put the Senate into a recess long enough for the recess appointment window to open, it just takes a concurrent adjournment resolution of the two chambers.

That can pass with a simple majority in the House and the Senate. And Republicans will have a majority in both.

That doesn’t mean Democrats wouldn’t, or couldn’t, try to fight it. These adjournment resolutions are not debatable but they are amendable so Democrats could try and delay this with a vote-a-rama-style amendment process, but those last only hours, not long enough to block a cabinet pick forever.

The Supreme Court has ruled on questions about recess appointments, which makes the outcome of taking these questions to court uncertain. But, multiple sources warned CNN that it’s too soon to know how Democrats would proceed if Thune really did move ahead with this tactic.

Ultimately, Democrats’ best defense against recess appointments may be Republicans senators themselves. The Senate would have to pass an adjournment resolution with a simple majority and that means, again, Thune couldn’t lose more than a handful of his GOP members.

The key question then would be whether some Republicans would be willing to stand in the way of the executive branch circumventing their advise and consent role.
